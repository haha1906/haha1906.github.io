<div class="p"><span class="dc">"We sent Nūḥ to his people... but they called him a liar. We saved him, and those who were with him, on the Ark and We drowned those who rejected Our revelations."</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Aʿrāf 7:59,64</span>)</div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Finally, when the time came, Allāh (s.w.t.) said to Nūḥ (a.s.): "Go, take your family and enter the boat. I have not found any righteous men on the earth besides you.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>Take seven pairs of every <span class="wa">halal</span> (clean) animal and bird with you, and one pair from the unclean animals—a male and female of each—so that the birds and animals will survive.<span id="bookmarks2-3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>In seven days from now, I will send rain for forty days and forty nights on the earth. And I will wipe all the living beings that I have created on the earth".<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Nūḥ (a.s.) did all the commands of Allāh (s.w.t.) as he was told.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v7"></a>He took his wife,<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> sons and his daughters-in-law and got on the boat<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> in order to be saved from the flood.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v14"></a>As Allāh had said, big and small animals and birds of every kind came to Hazrat Nūḥ in pairs<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span>—male and female—and entered the boat.<span id="bookmarks14-15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>After that, Allāh closed the door of the boat. <span class="zv">11 </span> Then .... the flood began! All the springs in the earth gushed out. The gates of the sky were opened, <span class="zv">12</span> and strong rain fell on the earth for forty days and forty nights. <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="zv">23</span> At this time Hazrat Nūḥ was sitting inside the boat with his family: his wife, his sons Shīm, Ḥām, Yāfit, and their wives. <span class="zv">6 </span> At that time Hazrat Nūḥ was six hundred years old.<span id="bookmarks16"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Did all the rest die? <span class="dc">"So We opened the gates of the sky with torrential water, burst the earth with gushing springs: the waters met for a preordained purpose. We carried him along on a vessel of planks and nails."</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Qamar 54:11-13</span>).</div></div><span id="bookmarks16"></span><a id="v17"></a>
<div class="p">The flood of waters continued for forty days. As the water increased, it raised the boat high above the ground.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>Eventually the level of the water became so high that<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>even the highest mountains were below the water.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>There was so much water that it rose fifteen <span class="wa">dhirāʿs</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-4"><sup>e</sup></span> above the peaks of the mountains.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>Everything that lives on the ground died: animals, birds and humans. Indeed, all the creatures that breathe air perished.<span id="bookmarks21-22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>Allāh destroyed all life on the land — from humans to animals, from moving creatures on the ground to birds that fly on the sky. Only Hazrat Nūḥ and those who went into the boat with him were left alive.</div>
<div class="p">\it<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>Why would Allāh (swt) decree that Bānī Ādam should perish in a great flood? Perhaps a better question is why Bānī Ādam would not listen to the \wa daʿwa\wa \it of Hazrat Nūḥ. Did he not warn them, "Because of oppression and violence, Allāh (swt) will destroy all living things on the earth. Repent and help me build the boat that He has ordered." But they preferred oppression and violence. They would not abandon their evil ways. They did not want to worship Allāh, but instead wanted to defy Him.</div>
<div class="p">\it How are you responding to the violence and oppression that you face? Do you seek a place of refuge in the Creator's plan for your life? Or do you join those who oppress others and celebrate violence? Which "boat" will you enter?<span id="bookmarks24"></span></div><span id="bookmarks24"></span>
