<div class="s"><div id="s1">The miracles Allāh (s.w.t.) gave Mūsā (a.s.) <span class="dc">"(Mūsā) threw it down and– lo and behold!– it became a fast-moving snake. He said, ‘Pick it up without fear: We shall turn it back into its former state. Now place your hand under your armpit and it will come out white, though unharmed.’"</span> (<span class="xdc">Tā Hā 20:20-22</span>)</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Then Hazrat Mūsā asked, "What will I do if Banī Isrāʾīl do not believe me or do not listen to me?"<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>"What is in your hand?" said Allāh. "A walking stick," said Mūsā (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>"Throw it on the ground!" said Allāh. Mūsā (a.s.) threw the staff on the ground. The staff immediately turned into snake! <span class="dc">"When (Mūsā) saw it moving like a snake, he turned and fled. (Then We said,) 'Mūsā, do not be afraid...'"</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Naml 27:10</span>)<span id="bookmarks3"></span></div><span id="bookmarks3"></span><a id="v4"></a>
<div class="p">"Reach out and grab its tail," said Allāh (s.w.t.). When Mūsā (a.s.) grabbed the tail of the snake, the snake turned back into a staff!<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Allāh said, "After seeing this miracle, the people will believe that indeed I<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> sent you.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>Now put your hand inside your robe!" Nabī Mūsā put his hand inside his robe. When he took it out, he saw that his hand was white, like the hand of people with vitiligo!<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>"Put your hand inside your robe again!" said Allāh (s.w.t.). Mūsā (a.s.) put his hand inside his robe a second time. When he took it out, he saw that his hand was back to its previous state.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>"If people do not believe the first miracle, show them the second one," said Allāh (s.w.t.).<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>"If some people do not believe the second miracle either, then take water from the river Nīl and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the river will become red blood on the ground."<span id="bookmarks9"></span></div>

Untie my tongue, so that they may understand my words."</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span><span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>Allāh (s.w.t.) said, "Who gave man a tongue?

I Myself will help you; I will teach you what to say."<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>"Oh my Rabb, okay, send me, but give me another man as a helper," nabī Mūsā begged. <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span></div>

Or will you refuse his service? We human beings are the servants of Allāh (s.w.t.), and we should serve Allāh (s.w.t.). The original meaning of "<span class="wa">ibādāt</span>" is — "to serve".</span></div>
