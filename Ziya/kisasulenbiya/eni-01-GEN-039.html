<div class="s"><div id="s1">Yūsuf (a.s.) in Miṣr<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span></div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Hazrat Yūsuf's life in Miṣr started this way.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>Allāh (s.w.t.) space was always with him, and gave <span class="wa">baraka</span> in everything he did.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>Fūṭīfar noticed that Allāh was with Yūsuf, and that whatever work Yūsuf did ended successfully.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>So Fūṭīfar liked Yūsuf and trusted him. He put Yūsuf in charge of all of his household and all of his wealth.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>From that day on, Allāh (s.w.t.) started blessing the house of Fūṭīfar because of Yūsuf (a.s.). Allāh's blessing was obvious in his house, in his crops, and in his flocks.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>After this, Fūṭīfar didn't worry about anything — except for what to eat and drink! Hazrat Yūsuf took care of everything himself.<span id="bookmarks6"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Lust and a false charge</div></div>
<div class="p">Yūsuf (a.s.) was a handsome fellow with a well-built body. <a id="v7"></a>So Fūṭīfar's wife started looking at him with lust. Then one day she came to him and commanded: "Come, lie with me."<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>Yūsuf (a.s.) did not consent: "Lady, the master has trusted me and put me in charge of everything in his house.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>He has appointed me to the highest position. He gave everything to me, except you. You ARE his wife! How can I do this evil thing? How can I sin against Allāh (s.w.t.)?"<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>Even though Fūṭīfar's wife kept talking to him every day, Yūsuf (a.s.) never agreed to lay down with her, and kept avoiding her as much as possible.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>One day, he entered the house for something. There was nobody inside.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>Then Fūṭīfar's wife came and grabbed him by his shirt: "Come, come on! Lie with me!" she said. But Yūsuf (a.s.) ran out of the house.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>But his shirt was torn and left in the hand of the woman. When she saw him running away,<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>the woman started wailing: "My husband brought that ʿIbrāniy slave to mock us! He wanted to rape me!<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>When I shouted, he ran away, leaving his shirt."<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>Until her husband came, she did not give Yūsuf (a.s.)'s shirt to anybody.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>When her husband came, <span class="dc">they both ran toward the gate.</span> And the woman told her husband her made-up story: "That ʿIbrāniy slave you had brought here tried to violate my honour and he mocked me.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>When I shouted, he left his shirt and ran away."\dc* <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span><span id="bookmarks18"></span></div><span id="bookmarks18"></span><a id="v19"></a>
<div class="p">When Fūṭīfar heard his wife's words, he became very angry. \it Then he investigated the event. It is written in the Qurʾān that: <span class="dc">A member of her household suggested, "If his shirt is torn at the front, then it is she who is telling the truth and he who is lying. But if his shirt is torn at the back, then she is lying and he is telling the truth."</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span> So, after that, even though Yūsuf was not guilty,<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>Fūṭīfar threw him into the prison where Firʿawn's prisoners were kept.</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p">\it (As it is written in the Qurʾān, before Yūsuf (a.s.) was put in jail, the city women were gossiping and accusing Fūṭīfar's wife. This was because loving affection between a noble woman and a foreign slave was a shameful situation. Because of that, the wife of Fūṭīfar invited the city women as guests and gave them knives. Then she invited Yūsuf (a.s.) in. The city women cut their hands when they saw him and they said, "This is not a human but an angel!" and they were attracted to him.)<span id="bookmarks20"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">Yūsuf (a.s.) in prison</div></div><span id="bookmarks20"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p">But Allāh (s.w.t.) was with Yūsuf (a.s.) in prison also. He was kind to Yūsuf, and made the heart of the prison-supervisor have favor toward Yūsuf.<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>For this reason, Hazrat Yūsuf was soon appointed as a responsible man in the prison and started managing the things of the prison.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>After that the prison-supervisor stopped worrying about the things Yūsuf (a.s.) was responsible for, because Allāh (s.w.t.) was helping Yūsuf (a.s.) in everything, and was always with him.<span id="bookmarks23"></span></div>
