<div class="s"><div id="s1">Quarreling for water</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Then by Allāh's order, the community of Isrāʾīl left the desert of Sīn and came to Rifīdīm and set up a camp. But in Rifīdīm there was no drinking water.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>So the people came to Rasulullah and said, "You must find us water to drink!" Mūsā (a.s.) tried to put the people on the right path by saying, "Why are you grumbling? Why are you trying to make Allāh (s.w.t.) follow your own judgment?"<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>But the people did not want to listen. They argued back and said, "Why did you bring us out of Miṣr? And now are you going to kill us, our children and our livestock with thirst?".</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Why did Mūsā (a.s.) bring them out of Miṣr? No, it was not Mūsā (a.s.) who brought them out, but Allāh (s.w.t.)! Why did Allāh (s.w.t.) bring them out of Miṣr? In order to kill them? No!! In order to take them to the land of milk and honey! Allāh (s.w.t.) promised this several times! But whenever there were small difficulties, the people would immediately start rebelling. With their stubbornness, they were testing the patience of Allāh (s.w.t.).</span><span id="bookmarks3"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Water comes out of a rock</div></div><span id="bookmarks3"></span><a id="v4"></a>
<div class="p">Then Rasulullah cried out to Allāh saying: "My Lord, how can I put these people on the right way?" The people were indeed ready to stone prophet Mūsā.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Then a voice came to prophet Mūsā from Allāh saying: "Take the staff with which you hit the river Nīl in your hand.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>Take several of the elders and go to the mountain of Saynāʾ. There I will show you a rock, and you will hit it with your staff. Then water will come out of the rock". Mūsā (a.s.) did as he was told. When the staff hit the rock, water began to come out of the rock in front of the eyes of the elders.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>Rasulullah named that place Miḥtah and Khuṣūmah <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span>. Because the people had tested Allāh (s.w.t.) there saying: "Is Allāh (s.w.t.) truly with us or not?"<span id="bookmarks7"></span><span id="bookmarks7"></span></div>
