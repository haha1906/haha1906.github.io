<div class="s"><div id="s1">The visit of three guests <span class="dc">"Have you heard the story of the honoured guests of Ibrāhīm? ... They said, 'Do not be afraid,' and gave him good news of a son who would be gifted with knowledge."</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Dhāriyāt 51:24,28</span>)</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">One day Ibrāhīm (a.s.) was sitting at the door of his tent.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> In the middle of the day, he looked up and noticed that were three men standing in front of him. <span class="it">They were angels who came to tell Ibrāhīm (a.s.) about the will of Allāh. </span> Quickly he got up and ran to meet them. He bowed low, touching the ground with his head, and said:<span id="bookmarks1-2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>"Dear sirs, welcome, do not pass by and leave me.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>Let the servants bring some water, and wash your (plural) feet. Then you (plural) can rest a little while under the shadow of the tree.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Let me bring something to eat. Then you can continue your journey afterwards." They said: "Good, let it be as you have said."<span id="bookmarks5"></span></div><span id="bookmarks5"></span><a id="v6"></a>
<div class="p">Ibrāhīm (a.s.) ran into the tent and told Sārah: "Quick, take three basins of the best flour and bake good bread from it."<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>He himself ran to his herd, chose a fat calf and showed it to a servant. His servant quickly butchered it and started cooking it.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>After the meat was cooked, Hazrat Ibrāhīm brought it with milk and curds, and placed the food in front of the guests who were sitting under the tree. But... <span class="dc">"When he saw that their hands did not reach towards the meal, he found this strange and became afraid of them. But they said, ‘Do not be afraid. We have been sent against the people of Lūṭ.’"</span> (<span class="xdc">Hūd 11:70</span>)<span id="bookmarks8"></span></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p">Then the guests asked: "Where is your wife Sārah?" "Here, in the tent", Ibrāhīm (a.s.) answered.<span id="bookmarks9"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">"Next year Sārah will have a son"</div></div><span id="bookmarks9"></span><a id="v10"></a>
<div class="p">"Next year about this time I will come back", said one of the guests. "At that time your wife Sārah will have a son in her arms." Just then, Sārah was standing behind Hazrat Ibrāhīm, inside the tent, listening to the conversation. <span class="zv">12</span> When she heard the words of the guest, she laughed inside.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span><span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>She laughed because both she and Hazrat Ibrāhīm were advanced in years, and her menstruation cycle had also stopped long ago.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>"I am old now, so how can I have this joy?" she thought. "My husband has also become old..."<span id="bookmarks12"></span></div><span id="bookmarks12"></span><a id="v13"></a>
<div class="p">Then Allāh's messenger said to Prophet Ibrāhīm: "Why did Sārah laugh? Why does not she believe that she will have a child?<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>Is there anything that is impossible for Allah? Next year I will come back at this time, and Sārah will be holding a child in her arms."<span id="bookmarks14"></span></div><span id="bookmarks14"></span><a id="v15"></a>
<div class="p">"I did not laugh", said Mother Sārah being afraid.</div>
<div class="p">But he said: "No, you did laugh."<span id="bookmarks15"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">The purpose of the visit<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span> <span class="dc">\it "Will I hide what I am going to do?" said Allāh. "I have chosen him so that he would teach his children and his household what is right and just, and lead them on the path of Allāh. I will fulfil My promise given to him, and I will create a great powerful nation from him and I will distribute blessing through Ibrāhīm to all nations."</span></div></div><span id="bookmarks15"></span><a id="v16"></a>
<div class="p">Then the guests got up and started going toward the city of Sidūm. Hazrat Ibrāhīm also went with them to see them off.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v20"></a>They said said to Ibrāhīm (a.s.): "The people of Sidūm and ʿAmūrah<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span> have done very sinful deeds. So, many people are crying out because of what they are doing.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>For this reason we want to go and check out the cause of this cry, which has reached unto the <span class="wa">arsh</span>."<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-4"><sup>e</sup></span><span id="bookmarks21"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s4">The prayer of Ibrāhīm (a.s.)</div></div><span id="bookmarks21"></span><a id="v23"></a>
<div class="p">Hazrat Ibrāhīm did <span class="wa">duʿa</span> to Allāh and said, "Oh my Rabb, will You really destroy righteous people along with bad people?<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>If there are 50 good people, You won't destroy the city, will You?<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>Of course, You won't destroy good people along with bad people! Oh Rabb <span class="wa">al-ʿalamīn</span>, You always judge with justice!"<span id="bookmarks25"></span></div><span id="bookmarks25"></span><a id="v26"></a>
<div class="p">Allāh said, "Yes, if there are 50 good people found in Sodom, I will not destroy the city."<span id="bookmarks26"></span></div><span id="bookmarks26"></span><a id="v27"></a>
<div class="p">Ibrāhīm (a.s.) asked, "Oh my Rabb, though I am not worthy of anything, please give me permission to speak.<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v29"></a>What if there are 40 good people found?"</div>
<div class="p">Allāh said: "Even for 40 good people I will spare the city."<span id="bookmarks29"></span></div><span id="bookmarks29"></span><a id="v30"></a>
<div class="p">"My Rabb, do not be angry because I am speaking much, but what if there are 30 good people are found? What will happen then?"</div>
<div class="p">"In this case also I will not destroy the city", Allāh said.<span id="bookmarks30"></span></div><span id="bookmarks30"></span><a id="v31"></a>
<div class="p">"Oh Lord, forgive me for daring to speak; what if there are only 20 (good) people?"</div>
<div class="p">"For 20 people also I will spare the city," Allāh said.<span id="bookmarks31"></span></div><span id="bookmarks31"></span><a id="v32"></a>
<div class="p">Then Hazrat Ibrāhīm again asked for forgiveness and said: "What if 10 people are found? What will You do?"</div>
<div class="p">"If even 10 people were found, I will not destroy the city," answered Al-Raḥman. <span class="dc">"But We have not found Muslims there except one household (who is devoted to Allah)"</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-5"><sup>f</sup></span><span id="bookmarks32"></span></div>
