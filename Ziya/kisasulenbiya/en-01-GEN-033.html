<div class="s"><div id="s1">The brothers meet</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Then Yaʿqūb (a.s.) looked and saw his brother ʿIsāw coming with 400 men.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>So he put his children with their own mothers, and put Bilhā and Zilfā in front with their children. Then he put Liʾā and her children in the middle, and Rāḥīl and Yūsuf at the end of the line.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>And he himself walked in front of everybody and before he reached his brother, he bowed down to the ground seven times.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>ʿIsāw came out toward his brother running and hugged him and kissed him. Both wept.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Then ʿIsāw looked at the women and children and asked: "Who are these?" Yaʿqūb (a.s.) answered: "These are the children Allāh has given to your slave."<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>Then Bilhā and Zilfā came with their children and bowed down before ʿIsāw.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>Then Liʾā came with her children, and finally Rāḥīl and Yūsuf came and bowed down.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>Then ʿIsāw asked: "What were the flocks I saw on the way?" Hazrat Yaʿqūb said: "I sent them as a gift so you would be kind to me."<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>ʿIsāw said: "Oh my younger brother, keep your wealth for yourself. I have plenty of flocks."<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>Yaʿqūb said, "No, brother, if I have indeed found your favour, please, accept my unworthy gift. You have accepted me graciously,<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>now please accept my gifts also. I praise Allāh a thousand times that now I have plenty of wealth." Because Yaʿqūb (a.s.) kept insisting, ʿIsāw finally accepted the gifts.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>"Alright then, let us go. We'll go together", said ʿIsāw.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>But Hazrat Yaʿqūb said: "You see, brother, the children are still young. And we also have new born lambs and goats. If we make them walk harshly even for one day, they could all die.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>You go in front. I will go slowly behind with the flocks with my children. We'll see each other in al-Sharāhah."<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>ʿIsāw said: "Alright. Then let me leave some of my men with you." But Yaʿqūb (a.s.) refused, saying "No need, do not trouble yourself."<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>Then ʿIsāw returned to al-Sharāhah that same day with his men.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>Yaʿqūb (a.s.), however, went to Sūkūt with his family,<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>and from there he went to Nāblis in the land of Kanʿān safe and sound.</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">So you see, Hazrat Yaʿqūb has returned to Kanʿān safe and sound. Do you remember, when he was running away from Kanʿān and from his brother, he had said: "If Allāh brings me back to my father's house in peace, I will worship Him only."</span><span id="bookmarks18"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Thanksgiving of Yaʿqūb (a.s.) to Allāh</div></div><span id="bookmarks18"></span><a id="v19"></a>
<div class="p">After arriving in Nāblis, Hazrat Yaʿqūb bought some land from the sons of the governor of Nāblis for 100 silver coins. There he built a camp outside the city.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>Then he said: "You are the god who gave me protection and kept me safe and sound," and slaughtered sacrifices to Allāh.<span id="bookmarks20"></span></div>
