<div class="s"><div id="s1">Allāh (s.w.t.) reminds Isḥāq (a.s.) of His covenant promises</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">A famine started in the land like the famine that happened before in the time of Ibrāhīm (a.s.). For this reason Hazrat Isḥāq went to Jarār, to the land of the Qawm al-Jālūt, where Abū Malik was king.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>And then Allāh (s.w.t.) appeared to Isḥāq (a.s.) and said: "Do not go to Miṣr. Do not leave the territory of Kanʿān.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>I will be with you, and I will bless you. I will give all these lands to you and to your children. I will fulfill the promise which I swore to your father Ibrāhīm.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>Ibrāhīm listened to me. He obeyed My commandments, laws and rules. This is why I will multiply your descendants like stars in the sky. I will give all these lands to you (plural). All the nations of the earth will find blessing through your <span class="wa">zurriyya</span>."<span id="bookmarks4-5"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Promises given through the Covenant</div></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">So, Allāh (s.w.t.) promised Isḥāq (a.s.) three things:</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">&nbsp; that he will have many descendants,</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">&nbsp; that his descendants will possess the earth</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">&nbsp; and through his descendant all the nations of the earth will find blessing. </span></div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">If you remember, the prophet Ibrāhīm was also promised these same things.</span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">Isḥāq (a.s.) and the king of Jarār</div></div><span id="bookmarks4-5"></span><a id="v6"></a>
<div class="p">So, Hazrat Isḥāq was living in Jarār.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>He was afraid of people, thinking, if I say that she is my wife, they will kill me in order to marry her. So, he was telling everybody that Ribqah was his sister. (Ribqah was indeed very beautiful.)<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>Quite some time passed in between. One day the king of the Qawm al-Jālūt looked out a window and saw that Hazrat Isḥāq was playing with Ribqah.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>Then he called Isḥāq (a.s.) to his palace and said: "It looks like she is actually your wife! Why did you say she is your sister?" Hazrat Isḥāq said: "I was afraid to call her my wife, because I thought I would be killed."<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>The king said: "How could you do this? Did not you think that someone could marry her and join with her? You almost made us commit sin!"<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>Then he announced to everybody saying: "Whoever touches this man or his wife, will be killed!"<span id="bookmarks11"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s4">The blessing of Allāh (s.w.t.)</div></div><span id="bookmarks11"></span><a id="v12"></a>
<div class="p">That year Hazrat Isḥāq's crops gave 100 fold harvest! Allāh (s.w.t.) had blessed him very much.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>His wealth increased more and more, and he became a very rich man.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>He owned flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and slaves. Then the Qawm al-Jālūt started to envy him<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>and filled up his wells with dirt. Ibrāhīm (a.s.) himself had these wells dug when he was alive.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>Then the king of Jarār called Hazrat Isḥāq to himself and said: "You became quite rich and powerful. Now you have to move out of our land."<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>So Hazrat Isḥāq moved to the Valley of Jarār<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>and reopened the wells which were initially dug during the life of his father Ibrāhīm (a.s.), and later on were filled by the Qawm al-Jālūt.<span id="bookmarks18"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s5">ʿIsāw's wives</div></div><span id="bookmarks18"></span><a id="v34"></a>
<div class="p">When ʿIsāw was 40 years old, he married Yihūdit daughter of Bīʾirī al-Ḥittiy <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span>, then he married Bāsimah daughter of Īlūn al-Ḥitt.<span id="bookmarks34"></span> <a id="v35"></a>Hazrat Isḥāq and Ribqah were very very sad because of his pagan wives.<span id="bookmarks35"></span></div>
