<div class="s"><div id="s1">Yaʿqūb (a.s.) sends a message to his brother</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Yaʿqūb (a.s.) continued on his journey.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span><span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v3"></a>At that time ʿIsāw lived in the land of Idūm, in the place called Sharāhah. Hazrat Yaʿqūb sent messengers to his brother and instructed them carefully: "Go to my brother and say: 'Your slave Yaʿqūb sent us. Until now he has been living in the house of your uncle Labān.<span id="bookmarks3-4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Now he owns much cattle and many donkeys, sheep, goats and male and female slaves. Now he is returning to his father's land. He sent us to inform you with the hope that you will be kind to him.'"<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>The messengers went and returned and said: "We have met your brother. Now he is coming here with 400 people."<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>Yaʿqūb (a.s.) became afraid. He divided his flocks and the people in his family into two groups.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>He was thinking to himself, 'If my brother attacks me, maybe at least one group can escape.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>Then he knelt and prayed: "Oh Allāh! You are the <span class="wa">Ilāh</span> of my grandfather Ibrāhīm and my father Isḥāq! You told me to return to my land, to the house of my father. And You said You would give me a blessing!<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>I am not worthy of all the faithfulness and unfailing love you have shown me. When I left home, I did not have anything except the walking stick in my hand. Now I have many people and many flocks.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>I beg you, save me from my brother. I am afraid that he will attack and kill me, and my wives and children.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>You had promised me to bless me and to increase my descendants like the sands of the sea!"<span id="bookmarks12"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Gifts sent to ʿIsāw</div></div><span id="bookmarks12"></span><a id="v13"></a>
<div class="p">That evening, Yaʿqūb (a.s.) chose some animals to give as gifts to his brother ʿIsāw:<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 sheep, 20 rams,<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>30 camels with their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys and 10 male donkeys.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>Then he put each of them into a separate flock, and appointed a servant for each and said: "Go ahead of me with the animals. Keep some distance between the herds." To the first servant he said:<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>"When you meet my brother ʿIsāw, he will ask: 'Whose servants are you? Whose animals are these?'<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>Then you should say: 'These belong to your brother Yaʿqūb. He has sent them to my master ʿIsāw as a gift. He is coming also behind us.'"<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>And Yaʿqūb (a.s.) told his other servants who would lead the other flocks, "When you meet my brother ʿIsāw, say the same thing.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>Then do not forget to say: 'Your brother Yaʿqūb is coming behind us.'" He hoped that by sending these gifts ahead of himself, he win over his brother's heart and his brother would treat him well when they met.<span id="bookmarks20"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">An encounter at night</div></div><span id="bookmarks20"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p">So Hazrat Yaʿqūb sent the flocks which he had set aside as gifts.<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>Several hours later, at night, he took his two wives, two concubines, eleven sons and all his wealth to the other side of the river Yabbūq.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>Then he himself returned to his tent alone.<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>Then <span class="it">an angel of Allāh </span> came <span class="it">in the form of </span> a man and wrestled with him until daybreak.<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>Finally, seeing that he could not conquer Hazrat Yaʿqūb, he struck him heavily and dislocated his joint of his hip.<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>Then he said: "Now let me go, the morning is almost here." "No,' Yaʿqūb (a.s.) said, 'I won't let you go unless you bless me."<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>Then he asked: "What is your name?" "Yaʿqūb".<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>"From now on, your name won't be Yaʿqūb. You will be called Isrāʾīl,<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> because you struggled with people all of your life and even with angel and withstood the trials of Allāh."<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>"What is your name?" asked Yaʿqūb (a.s.). But he did not answer, saying: "Why do you ask?" Then he blessed Hazrat Yaʿqūb.<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>(Later on Hazrat Yaʿqūb named that place Faniʾīl", saying "I have been with the angel of Allāh face to face, but I am still alive."<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>When Hazrat Yaʿqūb was leaving Faniʾīl, the sun was just rising. Because his hip was injured, he was limping.<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>(For this reason Banī Isrāʾīl does not eat the hip tendon even today.)<span id="bookmarks32"></span></div>
