<div class="s"><div id="s1">"I will go to my son!"</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">So Yaʿqūb (a.s.) took all of his household and departed. When they arrived in Biʾr Sabaʿ, he offered sacrifices to Allāh (s.w.t.).<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>That night he had a dream: "Yaʿqūb! Yaʿqūb!" "Yes, sir", answered Yaʿqūb (a.s.)<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>"I am the <span class="wa">ilāh</span> of your father Isḥāq. Do not be afraid to go to Miṣr. I Myself will be with you and will create a big nation from you (plural) in Miṣr. You will die there beside your son Yūsuf. Later on, I will bring your descendants back from there to Kanʿān."<span id="bookmarks3-4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Hearing this, Yaʿqūb (a.s.) and his family left from Biʾr Sabaʿ and headed for Miṣr. He took all of his sons, daughters, grandchildren, and all of his wealth and animals, flocks and herds. Hazrat Yaʿqūb, the women and young children were riding on the carts Firʿawn had sent.<span id="bookmarks5-7"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Father and son meet <span class="dc">"Then, when they presented themselves before Yūsuf, he brought his parents close to him and he said, "Welcome to Miṣr: you will all be safe here, if Allāh wills." And he took them up to [his] throne. They all bowed down before him. He said: "Father, this is the fulfilment of that dream I had long ago. My Rabb made it come true."</span> (<span class="xdc">Yūsuf 12:99-100</span>).</div></div><span id="bookmarks5-7"></span><a id="v28"></a>
<div class="p">When they arrived in the region of al-Sadīr,<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>Yūsuf (a.s.) got in his royal chariot and went there to meet his father. As soon as he saw his father, he embraced him and cried for some time.<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>"Finally I have seen you again", said hazrat Yaʿqūb. "Now I can pass from this world without sorrow. I thought I would die without seeing you."<span id="bookmarks30"></span></div><span id="bookmarks30"></span><a id="v31"></a>
<div class="p">Then hazrat Yūsuf spoke to his brothers: "Let me inform Firʿawn that you have come.<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>I will tell him that you are shepherds and that you have brought all of your sheep and cows and everything you own.<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>Then Firʿawn will call you and ask about your profession.<span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a>When he asks, tell him that you have been shepherding animals since your youth. Then he will let you live in al-Sadīr," he said.<span id="bookmarks34"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">The household of Yaʿqūb (a.s.)</div></div><span id="bookmarks34"></span><a id="v8"></a>
<div class="p">Below is the list of hazrat Yaʿqūb's sons and grandchildren who moved to Miṣr:<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>Yaʿqūb's (a.s.) first son was Raʾūbin, born from Liʾā, and Raʾūbin's sons were Ḥānūkh, Fallū, Ḥiṣrūn and Karmī.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>His second son was Samīʿun, and Samīʿun's sons were Yimūʾīl, Yamīn, Uhād, Yakhīn, Ṣuḥar and Shāʾūl. (Shāʾūl's mother was one of the Kanʿāniyyūn).<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>The third son was Lāwī, and his sons were Ghīrshūn, Qihāt and Mirarī.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>The fourth son was Yahūdā, and Yahūdā's sons were ʿĪr, Unān, Shīlah, Fīriṣ and Zāraḥ. Fīriṣ's sons were Ḥiṣrūn and Ḥamūl (but ʿĪr and Unān were not alive at this point. They had died long ago in Kanʿān).<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>The fifth son was Yissākhār, and his sons were Tūlāʿ, Fuwā, Yashūb and Shimrūn.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>The sixth son was Zībūlūn, and Zībūlūn's sons were Sīrid, Īlūn and Yaḥliʾīl.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>These were the sons of Liʾā born to Yaʿqūb (a.s.) in Faddān Ārām. Liʾā's daughter Dīnah was also born in Faddān Ārām. Hazrat Yaʿqūb had 33 descendents born from Liʾā, including the grandchildren and grand-grandchildren.<span id="bookmarks15"></span></div><span id="bookmarks15"></span><a id="v18"></a>
<div class="p">Hazrat Yaʿqūb had 16 descendents from Zilfā (the maidservant Lābān gave to Liʾā).<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v16"></a>The first son of Zilfā was Ghād, and Ghād's sons were Ṣibyūn, Ḥajjī, Shūnī, Iṣbūn, ʿĪrī, Arūdī and Arʾīllī.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>Zilfā's second son was Āshīr, and Āshīr's sons were Yimnah, Yishwah, Yishwī, Barīʿah and his daughter Sīraḥ. Barīʿah had two sons named Ḥībir and Malkiʾīl.<span id="bookmarks17"></span></div><span id="bookmarks17"></span><a id="v19"></a>
<div class="p">Yaʿqūb (a.s.) had two sons from Rāḥīl: Yūsuf and Binyāmin.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>In Miṣr hazrat Yūsuf married Asenath the daughter of Futifiraʿ, the priest of Ūn and had two sons named Minashshih and Ifrāyim.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>Binyāmin had ten sons: Bilaʿ, Bīkhir, Ashbīl, Jīrā, Naʿamān, Iḥī, Rūsh, Mufīm, Ḥufīm and Ārd.<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>So Yaʿqūb's (a.s.) descendents born from Rāḥīl were 14 people altogether, including grandchildren.<span id="bookmarks22"></span></div><span id="bookmarks22"></span><a id="v25"></a>
<div class="p">Hazrat Yaʿqūb had seven people born from Bilhā (Lābān's maidservant given to Rāḥīl).<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v23"></a>Bilhā's first son was Dān, and Dān's son was Ḥushīm.<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>Her second son was Naftālī, and Naftālī's sons were Yaḥṣiʾīl, Ghūnī, Yiṣīr and Shillīm.<span id="bookmarks24"></span></div><span id="bookmarks24"></span><a id="v26"></a>
<div class="p">Hazrat Yaʿqūb's descendants who came with him to Miṣr (without counting the daughters-in-law) numbered 66 people altogether.<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>If we include Yūsuf (a.s.) and his two sons born in Miṣr (and Liʾā's daughter Dīnah), they all add up to 70 people. So hazrat Yaʿqūb's household in Miṣr was 70 people.<span id="bookmarks27"></span></div>
