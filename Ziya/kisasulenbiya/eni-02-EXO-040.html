<div class="p"><span class="it">Allāh then ordered Mūsā (a.s.) to build another tent. And from now on, the sacrifices and offerings devoted to Allāh (s.w.t.) were to be done here. The Tent was enclosed all around with walls, and in its yard there was a special place separated for the altar, and in front of the door of the Tent, there was a special vessel for taking ablution. It was not permitted to enter the Tent without taking ablution. Inside of the tent consisted of two rooms, and they were separated from each other with an expensive curtain. The outside room had things used by priests for ibādāt. And the inside room was called "The Holy of holies", and nobody was allowed to enter it, except the high priest. The Arc of the Covenant, inside which there was the Covenant-book, <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> was also there in this inside room.</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="zv">Num.9:15 </span> On the day the Tent was put, a cloud came and covered the Tent -- the Maskan where the Covenant-book was kept. All night till the morning something like fire was shining from the cloud. This event was repeating everyday: in the daytime the cloud, at night the fire was covering the Tent.</div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Under Allāh's protection</div></div><a id="v34"></a>
<div class="p">The glory of Allāh (s.w.t.) was covering the Tent in the form of bright cloud.<span id="bookmarks34"></span> <a id="v36"></a>Whenever the cloud lifted up from the Tent and moved, the Banī Isrāʾīl also got on the way taking their belongings, <span class="zv">Num.9:17 </span> and whenever the cloud stopped, the nation of Isrāʾīl also stopped and set up camps. <span class="zv">Num.9:19 </span> Sometimes the cloud would not lift up for a long time, and this is why the people also would stay waiting without going anywhere. <span class="zv">Num.9:20 </span> Sometimes the cloud remained over the Tent only for a short time. <span class="zv">Num.9:22 </span> The Banī Isrāʾīl had (stopped) in some places for 2 days, sometimes one month, and sometimes several months in the same place. <span class="zv">Num.9:23 </span> By the command of Allāh (s.w.t.) they would stop, and by the command of Allāh (s.w.t.) they would start the journey.<span id="bookmarks36"></span> <a id="v38"></a>During the whole trip the cloud of Allāh was before the eyes of the people. During the daytime it guided the nation in the form of a cloud, and at night in the appearance of fire.<span id="bookmarks38"></span></div>
