There are words in Imam Bukhārī and Muslim: \"Allāh created Ādam in His own ṣūra.\" So, how can we understand this sentence? <span class=\"wa\">Al-insān</span> (mankind) is a creature and Allāh is Creator, so how can we be like Allah? We are not perfect. We have many blemishes and shortcomings. And the Qur'an says: <span class=\"dc\">\"There is nothing like him\"</span> (<span class=\"xdc\">Al-Shūrá 42:11</span>). This means that that mankind cannot compare to Allāh (s.w.t.)'s perfection. However, this <span class=\"wa\">āya</span> does not mean that mankind does not have some qualities that are guided by the perfection of Allāh (s.w.t.). Imam Ghazālī, speaking about this issue, says: \"The life-purpose of <span class=\"wa\">al-insān</span> is reflected in the meanings of <span class=\"wa\">al-asmāʾ al-ḥusnā</span>(Allāh's perfect names). Man imitates these beautiful names, tries to decorate his character with them, and as much as possible, tries to be worthy to these names, in order to be closer to al-Ḥaqq.\"</span></div>",
