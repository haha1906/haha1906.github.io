<div class="m">When Firʿawn demands a miracle, let Hārūn throw down his staff before him. The staff will turn into a snake."<span id="bookmarks9"></span></div><span id="bookmarks9"></span><a id="v10"></a>
<div class="p">So Mūsā and Hārūn (a.s.) went back to Firʿawn. Just like Allāh (s.w.t.) had said, Firʿawn demanded a miracle. Then Hārūn (a.s.) threw his staff down on the ground before Firʿawn. The staff immediately turned into a snake.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span><span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>When he saw this miracle, Firʿawn called in<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> his scholars and magicians. The magicians of the Miṣriyyūn also threw their staffs to the ground and made them turn into snakes.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>But Hārūn's snake was stronger than theirs. It swallowed<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span> all the staffs that the Miṣriyyūn had thrown down (which had turned into snakes).<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>Even then Firʿawn acted stubborn and did not let Banī Isrāʾīl go, just as Allāh (s.w.t.) had warned Mūsā (a.s.) from the beginning.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="zv">7 </span> At that time Mūsā (a.s.) was eighty years old, and Hārūn (a.s.) was eighty three years old.<span id="bookmarks13"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s1">The first plague</div></div><span id="bookmarks13"></span><a id="v14"></a>
<div class="p">"The heart of Firʿawn is still like stone, and he does not want to let My people go," said Allāh (s.w.t.) to Mūsā (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>"Go meet him tomorrow morning on the bank of al-Nīl when he comes out to the river. Take your staff with you, the one that turned into a snake.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>Tell him: "Allāh (s.w.t.) sent me to you again. He ordered me to tell you, 'Let My people go.' But you have not obeyed yet.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>So now Allāh (s.w.t.) is going to send a plague to your land. I will hit the river Nīl with my staff, and the river will turn into blood. Then you will be convinced about Allāh's power. As soon as you touch the water with the staff, the water will turn into blood.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>All the fish will die, the water will stink and the Miṣriyyūn will not be able to drink even a drop from the river.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>Then tell Hārūn to stretch the staff over all the rivers, canals, ditches and water reservoirs in Miṣr. Then the water in them, and even the water in jugs, will turn into blood".<span id="bookmarks19"></span></div><span id="bookmarks19"></span><a id="v20"></a>
<div class="p">Nabī Mūsā did as Allāh (s.w.t.) had commanded. The river Nīl turned into blood.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>The fish died and the water stank. The Miṣriyyūn could not drink the water from the river. All over Miṣr the water reservoirs turned into blood.<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>Then the magicians of Miṣr also turned water into blood with their magic. When Firʿawn saw this, he again made his heart like stone and as Allāh had warned from the beginning, he did not let Banī Isrāʾīl go.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>(He did not even pay attention to Allāh's power.)<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>Then the Miṣriyyūn began to dig wells along the bank of the river to find drinking water, because blood was flowing in the river instead of water.<span id="bookmarks24"></span></div>
