<div class="s"><div id="s1">THE BAKER AND BUTLER SEE DREAMS<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span></div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">A long time passed after that. One day Firʿawn's baker and butler offended their royal master<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v3"></a>and both were put in the prison where Yūsuf (a.s.) was.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>The commander of the Palace guards appointed Yūsuf (a.s.) to serve them.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>After that, quite some time passed, and one day at night both the butler and the baker saw dreams. Each of their dreams had its own meaning.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>In the morning Yūsuf (a.s.) came to them and saw that both of them looked troubled.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>"What happened?" he asked. "Why do you look upset today?"<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>They replied, "Yesterday we both happened to see dreams. But there is nobody here who can interpret our dreams," they said. Then Yūsuf (a.s.) said to them: "The ability to interprete dreams is given by Allāh. Tell me, what dream have you seen? Allāh (s.w.t.) may help with the interpretation."<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>First the butler narrated the dream he saw: "I saw a grapevine in front of me.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>It had three branches. Suddenly the branches budded, blossomed, and clusters of grapes ripened from the flowers.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>Then I looked and saw the wine cup of Firʿawn in my hand. I picked the grapes and squeezed the juice into the cup. Then I gave the cup to Firʿawn."<span id="bookmarks11"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Allāh interprets the dreams</div></div><span id="bookmarks11"></span><a id="v12"></a>
<div class="p">Yūsuf (a.s.) said: "Here is the interpretation of your dream: the three branches mean three days.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>In three days Firʿawn will free you from prison and will appoint you again as his butler.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>When your life gets back to normal, please, remember me also. Speak to Firʿawn about me and ask him to free me from this prison.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>I was taken from my homeland by force. I was put in prison here even though I did not any commit any crime here in Miṣr either."<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span><span id="bookmarks15"></span></div><span id="bookmarks15"></span><a id="v16"></a>
<div class="p">The baker saw that the butler's dream had a good interpretation, so he also told his dream to Yūsuf: "I saw in my dream that there were three baskets on my head.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>In the top basket there were different kinds of baked food for Firʿawn. And a flock of birds was eating that baked food in the basket."<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>"The interpretation of your dream is like this," said Yūsuf (a.s.). "The three baskets are three days.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>In three days, Firʿawn will will hang your body on a pole. Then birds will come and peck at it."<span id="bookmarks19"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">The dreams come true <span class="dc">"Fellow prisoners, one of you will serve his master with wine; the other will be hung and the birds will peck at his head. That is the end of the matter on which you asked my opinion."</span> (<span class="xdc">Yūsuf 12:41</span>) <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span> "Yūsuf said to the one he knew would be saved, 'Mention me to your master,' but Shayṭān made him forget to do this".<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span></div></div><span id="bookmarks19"></span><a id="v20"></a>
<div class="p">Firʿawn's birthday came three days later. On that occasion, he had a big feast prepared for all of his officials.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>Then, exactly as Hazrat Yūsuf interpreted, the butler was appointed to his previous position,<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>and the baker was hung on a pole.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>After getting restored to his position, however, the butler forgot about Yūsuf (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks23"></span></div>
