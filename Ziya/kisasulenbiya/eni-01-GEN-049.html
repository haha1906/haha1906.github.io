<div class="s"><div id="s1">A prophecy Yaʿqūb (a.s.) Made about his Sons <span class="dc">"(Ibrāhīm) commanded his sons to (devote themselves to Allāh), as did Yaʿqūb: 'My sons, Allāh has chosen (your) religion for you, so make sure you devote yourselves to Him, to your dying moment.'"</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Baqara 2:132</span>).</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Then Yaʿqūb (a.s.) called all of his sons and said:<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>"My sons, listen, I want to tell you what happens in the future.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>Raʾūbin! You are my firstborn son. You are the first fruit of my strength and power. In power and position you are higher than everybody.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>But you are as unstable as the water of the mountain. Because you defiled my honour, I deprive you of the right of the firstborn.<span id="bookmarks4"></span></div><span id="bookmarks4"></span><a id="v5"></a>
<div class="p">You Samīʿun and Lāwī! You are two of a kind. Both of you are without mercy and unkind.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>I do not participate in your council, and I do not take part in your evil plans. You killed people by your anger; you enjoyed cutting oxen's ligaments.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>Curses be on your merciless anger! Curses be on your unkind anger! I will scatter your descendants into all Isrāʾīl.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span><span id="bookmarks7"></span></div><span id="bookmarks7"></span><a id="v8"></a>
<div class="p">Yahūdā, you will conquer your enemies in battles. All of your brothers will praise you; they will bow down before you.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>You are like a big lion which came back from hunting and is taking a rest. Who can dare to bother him?<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>The royal staff will remain in your hand, until the <span class="wa">Wārith</span> comes whom all nations will obey.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>You will have an abundant life. What you eat will be in front of you; what you are going to eat will be behind you.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>You won't lack anything; your children will be healthy, strong and beautiful.<span id="bookmarks12"></span></div><span id="bookmarks12"></span><a id="v13"></a>
<div class="p">Zībūlūn, you will live on the seashore. You will be a port for ships. Your borders will extend toward Ṣīdūn.<span id="bookmarks13"></span></div><span id="bookmarks13"></span><a id="v14"></a>
<div class="p">Yissākhār, you are strong,<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>but you are ready to work like a donkey for everybody, for the things you like.<span id="bookmarks15"></span></div><span id="bookmarks15"></span><a id="v16"></a>
<div class="p">Dān, you will govern your tribe yourself.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>Though your tribe is small, it will punish enemies very well.<span id="bookmarks17"></span></div><span id="bookmarks17"></span><span id="bookmarks17"></span><a id="v18"></a>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">Oh Allāh, I am waiting for Your salvation!<span id="bookmarks18"></span></div><span id="bookmarks18"></span><span id="bookmarks18"></span><a id="v19"></a>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">Ghād, raiders will attack and conquer you, but later on you will chase them out.<span id="bookmarks19"></span></div><span id="bookmarks19"></span><a id="v20"></a>
<div class="p">Āshīr! You will have plenty of provisions. You will eat (different kinds of) royal food.<span id="bookmarks20"></span></div><span id="bookmarks20"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p">Naftālī! You are like a deer who is free, and whose children are beautiful.<span id="bookmarks21"></span></div><span id="bookmarks21"></span><a id="v22"></a>
<div class="p">Yūsuf! Like a vine who sprouts its branches to all sides, your descendants also will be many on the earth.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>Your enemies attacked you and showered arrows on your head,<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>but under the shadow (protection) of Yaʿqūb's mighty Rabb, Isrāʾīl's Shepherd and Mountain, your bow stayed solid, your hands stayed strong.<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>May Allāh of my forefathers help you! May Mighty Allāh bless you! May He shower His blessings on your head from the earth and sky! May He make your children many, and their provisions plenty!<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>Your father's prayers are greater than the eternal mountains. Yūsuf, you are a prince among your brothers; these blessings will be put on your head like crown.<span id="bookmarks26"></span></div><span id="bookmarks26"></span><a id="v27"></a>
<div class="p">Binyāmin! You are a fierce wolf. In the morning you attack your prey, in the evening you divide your prey."<span id="bookmarks27"></span></div><span id="bookmarks27"></span><span id="bookmarks27"></span><a id="v28"></a>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">With these words, Isrāʾīl (a.s.) distributed blessings to his children. Each of the 12 brothers received a blessing appropriate to his character. The 12 tribes of Isrāʾīl, the Banī Isrāʾīl came into existence from these 12 brothers.<span id="bookmarks28"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">The Burial of Hazrat Yaʿqūb <span class="dc">Were you there to see when death came upon Yaʿqūb? When he said to his sons,"What will you worship after I am gone?" they replied, "We shall worshop your Allāh, the Allāh of your fathers Ibrāhīm, Ismāʿīl and Isḥāq, one single Allāh: we devote ourselves (we are muslims) to Him"</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Baqara 2:133</span>)</div></div><span id="bookmarks28"></span><a id="v29"></a>
<div class="p">Then Yaʿqūb (a.s.) gave his dying wishes to his sons: "Now I am leaving this world. I will go and be added to the line of my ancestors. Bury me next to my fathers,<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>in the cave of al-Muḍāʿafah in Kanʿān. My grandfather Ibrāhīm had bought that place together with its field from ʿEfrūn al-Ḥittiy.<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>Your grandfathers Ibrāhīm and Isḥāq, as well as your grandmothers Sārah and Ribqah were buried there. I also buried Liʾā there.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span><span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>My grandfather Ibrāhīm bought that cave together with its field for that purpose from the Ḥittiyyūn."<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>After giving these instructions to his sons, he laid down on his bed and died.<span id="bookmarks33"></span></div>
