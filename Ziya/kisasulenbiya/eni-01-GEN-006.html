<div class="s"><div id="s1">The story of Nūḥ (a.s.)<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span></div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Many years passed. People increased in number on the earth. As they increased in number, the weight of their sin also increased.</span><span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Evil was increasing greatly; people were not living in the straight/right path; and all their thoughts were busy with evil. This caused Allāh (s.w.t.) to be very displeased, because the people who were created by Allāh went against the will of Allāh and chose the way of rebellion.<span id="bookmarks5-6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>Allāh said, "I will destroy mankind from the face of the earth."<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>But Allāh was pleased with the way Nūḥ (a.s.) lived.<span id="bookmarks8"></span></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p">Hazrat Nūḥ was loyal (wafāʿ) to Allah's covenant with him and was thankful for Allah's friendship. According to those people who were around him, he lived with <span class="wa">taqwā</span>.<span id="bookmarks9"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Verdict given for Sin</div></div><span id="bookmarks9"></span><a id="v11"></a>
<div class="p">Allāh (s.w.t.) saw that people were corrupted and given to violence. Every inclination of their heart was evil, and all the earth was filled with their unrighteous deeds and oppression.<span id="bookmarks11-12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>So He said to the prophet Nūḥ: "People have filled the earth with oppression. Now I will destroy all humanity.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>So I want you to build a boat from cypress wood and to put rooms in it. Then cover it with tar on both the inside and outside.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v16"></a>Make a roof for it and leave a 44 centimeter opening below the roof all the way around the boat. Put a door on its side, and build three decks inside the boat—lower, middle, and upper.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>I will send a flood of water upon the earth. And I will destroy all the people and animals on the earth.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>But with you I will make a covenant. I will save your family in the boat: you, your wife, your sons and your daughters-in-law".<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v22"></a>Then Hazrat Nūḥ obeyed all the commands of Allāh (s.w.t.) as he was told.</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span class="dc">"Nūḥ's people called the prophets liars"</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Shuʿarāʾ 26:105</span>).
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Imagine: The prophet Nūḥ was busy building a big boat in a field where there was no river or sea. <span class="zv">15</span> The length of the boat was about 137 meters, the width was 23 meters and its height was 14 meters<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span>. \it It took a long time to finish it. What did Nūḥ's (a.s.) friends and neighbours think when they saw him building the boat for so many years?</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Some people probably thought that he had lost his mind. Some laughed at him. And maybe some people did not like him telling them, "Allāh is going to send a flood to the earth, repent!" They probably thought, "What?! A flood?! What are you talking about?!" But the truth was, Allāh indeed had promised to send a flood upon the earth.</span><span id="bookmarks22"></span></div><span id="bookmarks22"></span>
