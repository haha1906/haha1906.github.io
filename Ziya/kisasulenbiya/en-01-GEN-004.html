<div class="s"><div id="s1">The story of Qābīl and Hābīl <span class="dc">"Tell them the truth about the story of Ādam’s two sons: each of them offered a sacrifice, and it was accepted from one and not the other. One said, ‘I will kill you,’ but the other said, ‘God only accepts the sacrifice of those who are mindful of Him.'"</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Māʾida 5:27</span>)</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Ādam (a.s.) and Ḥawwāʾ had children after that. They named the first son Qābīl and the second son Hābīl. Years passed and the boys grew up.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>Hābīl became a shepherd, and Qābīl became a farmer.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>One day Qābīl brought some of his harvest and consecrated/dedicated it to Allāh.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>But Hābīl slaughtered some of the best<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> sheep of his flock, and sacrificed the best part. Allāh (s.w.t.) was pleased with Hābīl and with his offering.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>But Qābīl and his offering were not approved/accepted. Qābīl was angry because of this, and he looked dejected.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>Allāh asked him, "Why are you upset? Why do you look dejected?<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>You must know that if you do deeds in the right way, you will be accepted. But if your deed is wrong, then Sin is waiting for you right by the door. If you do not be careful, it will master you! But in fact, you must control it!"</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">You see, when his sacrifice was not accepted, Qābīl got angry. He did not accept what Allāh did. And to do that is sin. If you open the way for sin, it will enslave you also. But instead, we must control our sin.</span><span id="bookmarks7"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">The power of sin <span class="dc">"His soul (<span class="wa">nafs</span>) prompted him to kill his brother: (Qābīl) killed him and became one of the losers."</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Māʾida 5:30</span>)<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span></div></div><span id="bookmarks7"></span><a id="v8"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Qābīl could not accept the advice of Allāh (s.w.t.). Instead of obeying Allāh, </span> he took his younger brother Hābīl to the wilderness and killed him.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>Then Allāh asked Qābīl: "Where is your brother Hābīl?" Qābīl answered, "I don't know. Am I the guard of my brother?"<span id="bookmarks9"></span></div><span id="bookmarks9"></span><a id="v10"></a>
<div class="p">"What have you done?!" said Allāh. "The blood of your brother is crying out to me from the ground!<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>And from now on, the ground will curse you.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>No matter how hard you work, the soil won't give you good crops. All of your life you will wander from place to place, far from your homeland!"</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Question: Why did Qābīl kill Hābīl? Why can't people stop themselves from sinful deeds most of the time? What do you think? Is there really a power in sin which can enslave a person?</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="dc">"We decreed to the Children of Isrāʾīl that if anyone kills a person– unless in retribution for murder or spreading corruption in the land– it is as if he kills all mankind, while if any saves a life it is as if he saves the lives of all mankind. Our messengers came to them with clear signs, but many of them continued to commit <span class="wa">isrāf</span> (excesses) in the land."</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Māʾida 5:32</span>).<span id="bookmarks12"></span></div>
