<div class="p">The angels arrived at Sidūm in the evening. When they entered the city, Hazrat Lūṭ<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> was sitting at the gate. When he saw the guests, he got up to meet them. He bowed low in front of them and said:<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>"Welcome, be my guests. You will spend the night in our house. Then tomorrow you can go where you want to go." "No," they said, "we'll spend the night in the city square"<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>But because Lūṭ (a.s.) insisted very strongly, they finally went to his house.</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p">After the evening meal,<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>before they all went to sleep, young and old men gathered from all over Sidūm and surrounded Lūṭ's (a.s.) house<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span>.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>They started shouting: "Lūṭ, oh Lūṭ, where are the people who came to your house today? Bring them out, let us taste them (i.e., have intimate relations with them)".<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>Then Hazrat Lūṭ went outside in front of the crowd and closed the door.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>He told them, "Brothers, please do not do this sinful thing!<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>Here, I have two virgin daughters. If you want, I will send them to you, and you can do whatever you want. Just do not touch these people. They are my guests, please understand!"<span id="bookmarks8"></span></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p">"You are standing in our way!" they shouted. "Get out! You're just a foreigner! Have you now become our boss?! Now we'll deal worse with you than with them!" Then they attacked Lūṭ (a.s.) and tried to destroy the door.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>At that time, the guests who were inside reached out and pulled Lūṭ back inside and locked/closed the door from inside.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>Then they blinded all the people who were outside, from old to young. They could not see anything and none of them could find the door.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>*</sup></span><span id="bookmarks11"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">The Punishment for Sin<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>c</sup></span></div></div><span id="bookmarks11"></span><a id="v13"></a>
<div class="p">"We are going to destroy the city completely," the angels said to Lūṭ. "So many people have cried out because of their wickedness that finally Allāh has sent us to destroy this city.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v12"></a>Do you have any other family here? Take all of them and quickly leave the city."</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">What do you think? If all the people of this city were so immersed in sin, then who cried to Allāh about them?</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Let us imagine that you were on a journey with your wife and children and you happened to pass through this city. The people of Sidūm were not hospitable. Where will you spend the night? That is right: on the street. If you are left on the street, what will they do to you? You can imagine... Then who do you call out to for help? To Allāh. According to what the angels said, very many people cried out because these people were so bad.</span></div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks12"></span><span id="bookmarks12"></span><a id="v14"></a>
<div class="p">Then Lūṭ (a.s.) went to his sons-in-law who were engaged with his daughters and said: "Quick, we need to leave the city! Allāh is going to destroy the city!" But they thought Lūṭ was joking.<span id="bookmarks14"></span></div><span id="bookmarks14"></span><a id="v15"></a>
<div class="p">When the morning light appeared, the angels urged Lūṭ (a.s.) and said: "Be quick, take your wife and daughters and leave, otherwise you will also die."<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>But he was hesitating. Then Allāh showed mercy to them. The angels took Lūṭ and his wife and his two daughters by the hand and took them outside the city.<span id="bookmarks16"></span></div><span id="bookmarks16"></span><a id="v17"></a>
<div class="p">"Do not stop anywhere", one of the angels said. "Do not look back. Run to the mountain, otherwise you will die!"<span id="bookmarks17"></span></div><span id="bookmarks17"></span><a id="v18"></a>
<div class="p">"No, sir, please!" Lūṭ (a.s.) begged.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>"You have been so kind to us! You did so much goodness by saving our lives. But I can not flee to the mountain, because before we reach it, the disaster will catch up to us and we will die.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>Here, there is a small town further on, a very small town. Let us go there to save our lives."<span id="bookmarks20"></span></div><span id="bookmarks20"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p">"Ok, I accept your request," the angel said. "I won't destroy the town you spoke about.<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>Now be quick, save your lives! Because until you do so, I cannot do anything." (For this reason, this town was called <span class="it">Ṣūghar</span> later on.)<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-4"><sup>d</sup></span> <span class="dc">"They wandered on in their wild intoxication and the blast overtook them at sunrise: We turned their city upside down and rained on them a shower of clay stones. There truly is a sign in this for those who can learn."</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Ḥijr 15:72-75</span>)<span id="bookmarks22"></span></div><span id="bookmarks22"></span><a id="v23"></a>
<div class="p">Lūṭ (a.s.) came to Ṣūghar when the sun was rising.<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>Then Allāh (s.w.t.) started showering burning stones from the sky on top of the cities of Sidūm and ʿAmūrah.<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>The other towns and villages in the valley, all living creatures living there, and the grass and trees with them all burned and were destroyed.<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>Lūṭ's (a.s.) wife looked back and turned into a pillar of salt.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-5"><sup>e</sup></span><span id="bookmarks26"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">***</div></div><span id="bookmarks26"></span><a id="v27"></a>
<div class="p">The Prophet Ibrāhīm got up early that day and went toward Sidūm.<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>Coming closer to the valley, he looked at the cities of Sidūm and ʿAmūrah from a distance. Smoke was rising everywhere, like smoke from a furnace.<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>When Allāh was destroying these cities, He saved Lūṭ from the disaster because of Ibrāhīm (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks29"></span></div>
