<div class="s"><div id="s1">Allah (swt) makes an <span class="wa">ahd</span> with Ibrāhīm (a.s.)</div></div>
<div class="ip"><span class="dc">"Whose religious devotion could be better in religion than those who direct themselves wholly to Allah, remain virtuous, and follow the <span class="wa">ḥanīf</span> religion of Ibrāhīm? Allāh took Ibrāhīm as a friend."</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Nisāʾ 4:125</span>)</div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">One day Allāh spoke to Hazrat Ibrāhīm: "Leave the house of your father and go to the land that I will show you.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>I will create a great nation from you. I will give you blessings and make your name great. You will be a source of blessings.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>I will bless those who bless you, but I will curse those who treat you lightly. Through you, all the tribes of the earth will become part of my chain of blessing."</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="ip"><span class="it">Allāh (s.w.t.) had a desire that all humanity would be restored to the closeness they shared with him on the Day of <span class="wa">Alast</span>, so that the <span class="wa">khilāfa</span> of Hazrat Ādam would be continued. For this reason He decided to make an <span class="wa">ahd</span> (covenant) with Ibrāhīm (a.s.). </span><span id="bookmarks3"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">The Promise about Blessing</div></div>
<div class="ip"><span class="it">In this way Allāh (s.w.t.) took Ibrāhīm (a.s.) under His protection and said: "All the tribes of the earth will find blessing through you." Do you remember that in the beginning, Ādam (a.s.) and Ḥawwāʾ lived in Janna, in the presence of Allāh? But then they ate the forbidden fruit and went astray from <span class="wa">fiṭra</span>. As a result, sin and death and a curse came on the earth so that all mankind is pulled away from the <span class="wa">fiṭra</span> of their declaration on the Day of <span class="wa">Alast</span>. There was a clear reason that Allāh warned them by saying: "You will die on the same day you eat that fruit!" (Here, the meaning was not just about physical death, but also about spiritual death. In other words, they lost the closeness they experienced with Allāh (s.w.t.) in Janna when they still followed the the <span class="wa">ḥanīf</span> religion of their <span class="wa">fiṭra</span>. </span></div>
<div class="ip"><span class="it">And now Allāh is giving a promise to Nabī Ibrāhīm to restore the blessing of faith. This blessing will be given to all people groups, that is, all the tribes of the world. If anybody becomes a member of Ibrāhīm's household and makes <span class="wa">bayʿah </span> to the <span class="wa">ḥanīf</span> religion of their <span class="wa">fiṭra</span>, that person will have a part in that same blessing. His sins will be forgiven and he will become one of the people who is close to Allāh. This is why the Qurʾān says: <span class="dc">"Follow the \dc \wa ḥanīf\wa* religion of Ibrāhīm."</span> </span><span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span></div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks3"></span><a id="v4"></a>
<div class="p">At that time Hazrat Ibrāhīm was 75 years old.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>He obeyed Allāh and left Hārān, and went to the land of Kanʿān. He took his wife Sārah <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span>, his nephew Lūṭ<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span> (a.s.), his servants and all the wealth he had gained in Hārān.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v7"></a>When they arrived in Kanʿān, Allāh (s.w.t.) gave a revelation to Ibrāhīm (a.s.) and said: "I will give all this land to your descendants." (At that time Hazrat Ibrāhīm was still childless.)</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="ip">\it Ibrāhīm (a.s.) is famous among the prophets by the name "Khalilullah", which means "Allāh's friend". He was called this because love for Allāh (s.w.t.) filled every aspect of his being. He trusted Allāh (s.w.t.). And because he trusted Him, he was obeying Him. When Allāh told him to go, he started the journey even though he did not know where he was going. Because of his trust in Allāh, he left and lived as a stranger, away from his people. He lived the life of a nomad for the sake of Allah (s.w.t.). He had high regard (ḥusn al-ẓann) for Allāh because he loved Allāh and knew that he was Allāh's beloved.<span id="bookmarks7"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">Ibrāhīm's (a.s.) trip to Miṣr</div></div><span id="bookmarks7"></span><a id="v10"></a>
<div class="p">Some time later a severe famine started and Nabī Ibrāhīm went to Miṣr to live there temporarily.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>As they were approaching Miṣr, he said to his wife Sārah: "You are very beautiful.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>If the Miṣriyyūn learn that I am your husband, they will kill me in order to have you.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>This is why you should tell them that you are my sister.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span> Then they will treat me well and will not kill<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-4"><sup>e</sup></span> me."<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>Indeed, as soon as they arrived in Miṣr, the beauty of Sārah attracted everybody's attention.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>When Firʿawn's officials saw her beauty, they told<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-5"><sup>f</sup></span> Firʿawn about it. Then Sārah was taken to his palace.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-6"><sup>g</sup></span><span id="bookmarks15"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s4">But then...</div></div><span id="bookmarks15"></span>
<div class="p"> <a id="v17"></a>But Allāh (s.w.t.) inflicted a bad disease on Firʿawn and his palace people, because they brought Sārah to the palace.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>When Firʿawn understood what was happening, he became afraid and immediately called Hazrat Ibrāhīm to his palace and told him: "Why have you done this? Why didn't you say that Sārah is your wife?<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>Why did you call her "my sister"? If you have told the truth, I would not have brought her to the palace. Go, take your wife, and leave my country."<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>Then he commanded his people: "Take this man to the border of my country, with all of his wealth<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-7"><sup>h</sup></span> and with his wife!" So, Ibrāhīm (a.s.) returned Kanʿān with his wife and with all of his possessions.<span id="bookmarks20"></span></div><span id="bookmarks20"></span>
