<div class="p">Allāh (s.w.t.) fulfilled His promise: Mother Sārah became pregnant,<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>and bore a son to Ibrāhīm (a.s.) at the time which had been said.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>Prophet Ibrāhīm named his son Isḥāq and<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>on the 8th day he circumcised him, as Allāh had commanded.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>At that time Ibrāhīm (a.s.) was 100 years<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> old.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>Sārah said, "Allāh has given me laughter. Now whoever hears it will laugh with me.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span><span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>Who thought that I would nurse a baby one day?! Even though my husband has become old, I have borne him a son!"</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks7"></span>
<div class="mt"><div id="mt1">The Story of Ismāʿīl (a.s.) <span class="dc">“Mention too, in the Qur an, the story of Ismāʿīl. He was true to his promise, a messenger and a prophet.”</span> (<span class="xdc">Maryam 19:54</span>).</div></div><span id="bookmarks7"></span><a id="v8"></a>
<div class="p">\it Our mother Sārah was jealous of Hājar. Many scholars narrated about this<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span>. As Ṭabarī writes, Sārah drove Hājar twice from the house.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span></div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p">One day Ibrāhīm (a.s.) gave a big feast on the occasion of his son Isḥāq being weaned (separated from mother's milk).<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>When Sārah saw that Hajar's son Ismāʿīl was sitting and laughing,<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>she went to Ibrāhīm (a.s.) and demanded: “Drive away Hājar with her son! The son of a servant will not be a partner to the inheritance my son will receive”.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>Hazrat Ibrāhīm got very upset because of the words of his wife. Because Ismāʿīl also was his son!<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>But Allāh (s.w.t.) sent a <span class="wa">wahy</span> to Ibrāhīm (a.s.): “Do what Sārah said. My promise given about your descendant will be continued through Isḥāq. And don’t worry about Ismāʿīl and Hājar.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>I will keep them safe. I will make nations from Ismāʿīl’s offspring. Because he is also your child.”</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p">\it Yes, this also was a test that came from Allāh.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-4"><sup>e</sup></span> Is it easy to separate from your child? Ismāʿīl (a.s.) was the eldest son of Nabī Ibrāhīm.<span id="bookmarks13"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">The prayer of Ibrāhīm (a.s.)</div></div>
<div class="p">\it In Qurʾān al-Karīm, there is a prayer of Ibrāhīm (a.s.): <span class="dc">“Our Lord, I have established some of my offspring in an uncultivated valley, close to Your Sacred House, Lord, so that they may keep up the prayer. Make people’s hearts turn to them, and provide them with produce, so that they may be thankful.”</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-5"><sup>f</sup></span></div>
<div class="p">\it After Hājar and Ismāʿīl (a.s.) moved to a new location, Allāh (s.w.t.) Himself cared for them. He himself kept them under His protection. The appearance of a well in the desert is also a <span class="wa">dalīl</span> to Allāh's mercy.</div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">A spring appears in the desert</div></div><span id="bookmarks13"></span><a id="v15"></a>
<div class="p">\it According to a ḥadīth of our prophet (s.a.v.) Hājar laid down Ismāʿīl (a.s.) under the shade of a bush \it and hung the waterskin on a branch. She, as well as her son were drinking water from that waterskin. After a while the water was all gone. <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-6"><sup>g</sup></span><span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>When water was gone, Hājar said: “It is better not to see the death of my son”, -- and <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-7"><sup>h</sup></span> went on a distance.</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Then she climbed up a hill and looked around seeking for water. Hoping to hear someone’s voice, she looked around. But there was no sound, no one was in sight. Then she ran down, looked around longingly, but still could see no one. Then she just wept and wandered between two hills.</span><span class="footnote selectable" id="F-8"><sup>i</sup></span></div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks16"></span><span id="bookmarks16"></span><a id="v17"></a>
<div class="p">Then Allāh’s angel appeared and said: “Hājar, hey Hājar, why are you crying? Don’t be afraid, your (two of you) cries reached the sky.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>Come on, get up and get your son up! Allāh will create a big nation from his offspring”.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>Allāh (s.w.t.) had opened a well for them there, but Hājar hadn’t seen it yet. Then Allāh (s.w.t.) directed her sight to the well. She looked – water! The water that gives life! She hastened and drank water. Then she filled the waterskin and gave water to the son.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>So, Allāh (s.w.t.) was always with them. Ismāʿīl grew in desert and became a skilful archer.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>Later his mother got a girl from Miṣr for him.<span id="bookmarks21"></span></div>
