<div class="s"><div id="s1">The story of how Isḥāq (a.s.) got married</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="it">A long time passed and Sārah died.</span> Ibrāhīm (a.s.) also became quite old. Allāh (s.w.t.) had blessed him in all aspects.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>One day Ibrāhīm (a.s.) called his most trusted servant and said,<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>"Come here! Swear that you won't marry my son Isḥāq with the Kanʿāni women<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> from here.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>You will go to my relatives in order to marry Isḥāq and you will bring a bride from them."<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>The servant asked, "What if the bride does not want to come here with me? Then should I send your son to your relatives' place?<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>Ibrāhīm (a.s.) said, "No! Do not send my son there!<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>Allāh gave me a promise when He took me from my motherland, saying: 'I will give this land to your descendants.' Allāh (s.w.t.) will send His angel with you. You will bring a wife from there to my son.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>If the girl does not agree to come here, then you are free from this oath. But just do not send my son there."<span id="bookmarks8"></span></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p">The servant of Ibrāhīm (a.s.) swore in front of his master<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>and loaded expensive gifts on ten camels. He made the journey and arrived in the region of Bilād al-Rāfidayn where Nāḥūr lived.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>Coming there, he made his camels kneel down at the well outside of the town/city. It was late in the day, and the town women were coming to the well to get water as usual.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>Then the servant spread his hands in prayer: "Oh Allāh, Provider who made a covenant with my master Ibrāhīm! I beg you, do not withhold your love from my master Ibrāhīm and make my work/mission happen.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>Here, I am standing at the well. There are young women coming from the city to get water.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>I will say to one of them, 'Put down your jar, let me drink a little.' If she says, 'Drink, and I will also draw water for your camels,' then I will know that this is the girl you have chosen for your servant Isḥāq, and I will know you have done a kind deed for my master Ibrāhīm."<span id="bookmarks14"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">The prayer was answered</div></div><span id="bookmarks14"></span><a id="v15"></a>
<div class="p">Before he had finished his prayer, there came a very beautiful girl to the well, carrying a jar on her shoulder. Her name was Ribqah, and she was the daughter of Bituʾīl, the son of Nāḥūr, the brother of Ibrāhīm (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>Ribqah went down to the well, filled her jar and came back up.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>Then the servant hurried to meet her and said: "Give me your jar, let me drink a little."<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>"Please, drink", Ribqah said, taking her jar down from her shoulder.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>Then she said: "Let me get water for your camels too."<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>She ran and poured the remaining water from her jar into the trough and ran again to get water. This way all the camels were satisfied with water.<span id="bookmarks20"></span></div><span id="bookmarks20"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p">The servant of Ibrāhīm (a.s.) was closely watching the girl, not saying a word, but thinking: "It looks like Allāh gave me success on my journey!"<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>When the camels had finished drinking water, he took an expensive gold nose ring and two big gold bracelets and asked Ribqah:<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>"Whose daughter are you? Is there a place to sleep in your father's house?"<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>The girl answered: "I am the daughter of Bituʾīl, the granddaughter of Nāḥūr and Milkah."<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>Then she said: "We have a place to sleep in our house. There is plenty straw and feed for your camels."<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>Then the servant of Hazrat Ibrāhīm put his head on the ground and worshipped Allāh (s.w.t.) and said:<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>"Oh Allāh, Allāh of my master Ibrāhīm! You have not held back Your love and faithfulness from my master. Even today you guided me to the relatives of my master. Praises be to You!"<span id="bookmarks27"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">At Bituʾīl's house</div></div><span id="bookmarks27"></span><a id="v28"></a>
<div class="p">The girl ran home and told her family what had happened.<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>She had a brother named Labān.<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>He heard what his sister said and saw the ring on her nose and bracelets on her wrists, he ran toward the well. The servant of prophet Ibrāhīm was still there, standing next to his camels.<span id="bookmarks30"></span></div><span id="bookmarks30"></span><a id="v31"></a>
<div class="p">Labān greeted him and said: "Why are you standing here? Come to our house. I have a place prepared for you. There is a place for the camels also."<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>All of them came to Labān's house. Labān's servants took down the loads and gave the camels straw and feed. Then they brought water for the servant of Ibrāhīm (a.s.) and his companions who came with him, so that they could wash their feet.<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>When the tablecloth was spread, the servant of Ibrāhīm (a.s.) said: "I won't eat bread unless I tell you why I came." "Is that so? Ok, then tell us", Labān said.<span id="bookmarks33"></span></div><span id="bookmarks33"></span><a id="v34"></a>
<div class="p">"I am the servant of Hazrat Ibrāhīm.<span id="bookmarks34"></span> <a id="v35"></a>Allāh (s.w.t.) has blessed my master very much. He has turned him into a great and famous man. He gave him flocks of sheep, herds, gold and silver, male slaves and female slaves.<span id="bookmarks35"></span> <a id="v36"></a>My master had a son when he became old, from his wife Sārah. Now he has given all of his wealth as inheritance to this son.<span id="bookmarks36"></span> <a id="v37"></a>My master called me and made me swear, saying: "Don't marry my son to any girl from the Kanʿāniyyūn,<span id="bookmarks37"></span> <a id="v38"></a>but go and get a bride from my father-land, from my relatives."<span id="bookmarks38"></span> <a id="v39"></a>I asked him, "What if the girl does not want to come with me?"<span id="bookmarks39"></span> <a id="v40"></a>He said: "I have put my faith in Allāh (s.w.t.). He will send His angel with you, and will make your trip successful. You will get a wife for my son from my relatives, from my father's household. Go to my relatives.<span id="bookmarks40"></span> <a id="v41"></a>If they don't give you a bride, you will be free from this oath."<span id="bookmarks41"></span> <a id="v42"></a>Today I prayed to Allāh at the well, saying: "Oh Allāh, please guide me. Here, I am standing near the well.<span id="bookmarks42"></span> <a id="v43"></a>If I meet a girl who comes for water and tell her: "Let me drink a little from your jar",<span id="bookmarks43"></span> <a id="v44"></a>and if she says to me: "Please, drink. I will draw water for your camels, too," then I will know that this is the girl You have chosen for Isḥāq"<span id="bookmarks44"></span> <a id="v45"></a>When I was praying these words in my heart, Ribqah came for water carrying a jar on her shoulder. She went to the well and filled her jar. I said to her: "Let me drink a little."<span id="bookmarks45"></span> <a id="v46"></a>She immediately lowered her jar from her shoulder and told me: "Please, drink." Then she said: "Let me draw water for your camels also."<span id="bookmarks46"></span> <a id="v47"></a>When the camels were satisfied with water, I asked her: "Whose daughter are you?" She said: "I am a daughter of Bitūʾil, a granddaughter of Nāḥūr and Milkah." Then I put a ring on her nose, and bracelets on her wrists<span id="bookmarks47"></span> <a id="v48"></a>and I put my head on the ground, and gave thanks to Allāh. I praised Allāh (s.w.t.), Allāh of my master Ibrāhīm for bringing me here to give the granddaughter of my master's uncle to my master's son.<span id="bookmarks48"></span> <a id="v49"></a>So, that is everything that happened. What do you say? Will you accept the request of my master? If you do not agree, tell me. Then I will think about what to do next."<span id="bookmarks49"></span></div><span id="bookmarks49"></span><a id="v50"></a>
<div class="p">Lābān and Bitūʾil heard his words and answered: "This is from Allāh. What can we say?<span id="bookmarks50"></span> <a id="v51"></a>Here is Ribqah. Take her -- we agree. As Allāh has commanded, let her become the wife of your master's son.<span id="bookmarks51"></span> <a id="v52"></a>When the servant of Ibrāhīm (a.s.) heard this, he bowed down to the ground and worshipped Allāh (s.w.t.).<span id="bookmarks52"></span> <a id="v53"></a>Then he gave Ribqah the gold and silver jewelry and clothes that he had brought. He gave expensive gifts to Ribqah's brother and mother also.<span id="bookmarks53"></span> <a id="v54"></a>Then he sat down and ate and drank with his companions and spent the night there.<span id="bookmarks54"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s4">Going home</div></div>
<div class="p">The next morning he got up early and said: "Now with your permission, I will return to my master." <a id="v55"></a>But the brother and mother of Ribqah said: "Do not hurry, let our daughter to stay with us for another five to ten days, then you can leave."<span id="bookmarks55"></span> <a id="v56"></a>But he said, "Please let me go. Allāh (s.w.t.) has made this journey successful, so now do not make me wait.<span id="bookmarks56"></span> <a id="v57"></a>Let me return to my master." Then they said: "In this case, let us ask the girl herself, what does she think?"<span id="bookmarks57"></span> <a id="v58"></a>They called Ribqah and told her, "This man wants to leave. Will you go?" Ribqah answered, "Yes, I will."<span id="bookmarks58"></span> <a id="v59"></a>So they decided to send Ribqah with her nurse, together with Ibrāhīm's servant and his companions. Then they prayed:<span id="bookmarks59"></span> <a id="v60"></a>"Our sister Ribqah, may Allāh give you many, many children. May you have thousands of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. May your descendants take possession of their enemies' cities."<span id="bookmarks60"></span> <a id="v61"></a>Then Ribqah and her maidservants got on the camels, and they started the journey together with Ibrāhīm's servants.<span id="bookmarks61"></span></div><span id="bookmarks61"></span><a id="v62"></a>
<div class="p">At that time Isḥāq (a.s.) had come from al-Biʾr lil-Ḥayyi l-Nāẓir to the southern part of the country he was in.<span id="bookmarks62"></span> <a id="v63"></a>One day, he was outside in the field and was thinking, when he saw camels coming. Seeing the camels, he went toward them.<span id="bookmarks63"></span> <a id="v64"></a>When Ribqah saw Isḥāq, she immediately got off the camel and asked the servant of the prophet Ibrāhīm:<span id="bookmarks64"></span> <a id="v65"></a>"Who is this?" "It is my master," he said. So Ribqah put her scarf down over her face.<span id="bookmarks65"></span> <a id="v66"></a>Then the servant told Isḥāq about everything that had happened.<span id="bookmarks66"></span></div><span id="bookmarks66"></span><a id="v67"></a>
<div class="p">Isḥāq (a.s.) brought Ribqah into the Sārah's tent. When he married Ribqah, he was quite comforted after the death of his mother, because he loved Ribqah very much.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span><span id="bookmarks67"></span></div>
