<div class="s"><div id="s1">Disgrace</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">The name of the governor of the city was Ḥamūr al-Ḥawwiy and he had a son named Nāblis. One day, Liʾā's daughter Dīnah, went to visit some of the girls who lived nearby. Then Nāblis saw her and violated her honour.<span id="bookmarks1-2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>Nāblis was attracted to Dīnah. So he tried to find her heart with sweet words.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>Then he told his father what happened and asked him to get her as his wife.<span id="bookmarks4"></span></div><span id="bookmarks4"></span><a id="v5"></a>
<div class="p">Hazrat Yaʿqūb also heard that his daughter's honour was defiled, but he did not do anything until his sons came. At that time his sons were in the wilderness, with the flock.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>In the meantime, Ḥamūr visited Yaʿqūb's (a.s.) camp, with his son Nāblis. When they came and sat down, Dīnah's brothers also returned from the wilderness.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>When they heard what happened, they became very angry: this thing was a big evil and big disgrace for the household of Isrāʾīl.<span id="bookmarks7"></span></div><span id="bookmarks7"></span><a id="v8"></a>
<div class="p">Ḥamūr started speaking: "My son Nāblis fell in love with your daughter. So I came to you with the hope to become your relative.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>Let us become relatives. Let us arrange marriages between us.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>Here, our land is open for you (Plural). You can settle wherever you want. You can live with us, do business here, and gather wealth here..."<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>Then Nāblis said, "Please, do not say no. I will give you whatever you ask.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>I will pay whatever amount of bride-price, whatever gift you want. Please, just let me marry her."<span id="bookmarks12"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">A trick...</div></div><span id="bookmarks12"></span><a id="v13"></a>
<div class="p">Yaʿqūb's (a.s.) sons had the intention to take revenge.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>So they answered cunningly: "We cannot marry our sister to a man who is not circumcised. It would be a disgrace for us.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>If all the men in your tribe become circumcised like us, then it is a different matter.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>Only then we can intermarry with your people. Then we will live with you as one nation.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>If you do not agree to be circumcised, then we'll take our sister and go to another place."<span id="bookmarks17"></span></div><span id="bookmarks17"></span><a id="v18"></a>
<div class="p">Ḥamūr and Nāblis liked what they said.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>Nāblis had the highest reputation among his people. Because he loved Dīnah, he did not want to lose time,<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>so immediately he and his father Ḥamūr went to the city gate<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> and explained the situation to the people:<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>"These people are treating us nicely. So let us give them permission to live in our land and do business here. We'll take brides from them and they will take brides from our people. Our land is large; it is enough for us and for them.<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>They also agree to live with us as one nation, but they have one condition. And the condition is that our males must be circumcised like them.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>If we accept their condition, they will live with us. Their flocks and their wealth will be ours."<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>All the men sitting at the city gate accepted the suggestion of the governor, so all the men in the city got circumcised.<span id="bookmarks24"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">Revenge</div></div><span id="bookmarks24"></span><a id="v25"></a>
<div class="p">But on the third day, before their circumcision wounds had healed, Dīnah's brothers Samīʿun and Lāwī entered the city with swords. Without difficulty they slaughtered all the men of the city.<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>They killed Ḥamūr and his son Nāblis and took Dīnah from Nāblis 's house.<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>Then they plundered the city where their sister had been dishonoured.<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>They took all the flocks and cattle and donkeys they found in the city and in the fields.<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>They plundered everything they found in the houses and took the women and children captive.<span id="bookmarks29"></span></div><span id="bookmarks29"></span><a id="v30"></a>
<div class="p">Yaʿqūb (a.s.) did not know about these things. When he heard about it, he became very angry. "You have gotten me into big trouble now! You have ruined me!" Yaʿqūb (a.s.) shouted to Samīʿun and Lāwī. "Now the Kanʿāniyyūn as well as the al-Farizziyyūn have become our enemies. We are few in number. If they unite their forces and attack us, none of us will stay alive!"<span id="bookmarks30"></span></div><span id="bookmarks30"></span><a id="v31"></a>
<div class="p">"But why should we let him treat our sister like a prostitute?!" said Samīʿun and Lāwī. "We had to remove the disgrace from our family!"<span id="bookmarks31"></span></div><span id="bookmarks31"></span>
