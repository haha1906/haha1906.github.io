<div class="p">Then Allāh (s.w.t.) gave His command to Yūnus a second time: 'Go at once to the important city of Nināwā. Warn them with the message I will give to you'. So Yūnus (as) obeyed his Lord and went to Nināwā. Now Nināwā was a very large city and more than 100,000 people lived there. It was so large that it would take Yūnus three days to deliver Allāh's message to the entire city. On the first day of his visit, Yūnus entered into the city and began to warn its people: 'In forty more days Nināwā will be overthrown!'<span id="bookmarks1-4"></span></div><span id="bookmarks1-4"></span><a id="v5"></a>
<div class="p">When the Nināwiyyūn heard the message of Allāh, they made *tawba* and believed Allāh. They showed their <span class="wa">tawba</span> toward Allāh by fasting and wearing only clothes made from grain sacks.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> Everyone in the entire city obeyed Allāh's message, even old men and young children. Even though it was just the first day of Yūnus' visit, the warning stirred the heart of the king of Nināwā. He came down from his throne, stripped off his royal robes to wear clothes made from grain sacks, and sat in ashes to show his grief, which was their custom.<span id="bookmarks5-6"></span></div><span id="bookmarks5-6"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p">Then the king made an announcement throughout Nināwā:</div><span id="bookmarks7-9"></span>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">The decree of the King and his Nobles</div></div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="li top-spacing">-No one is allowed to taste anything on this day of grief—neither man nor animal, herd nor flock. The animals should not even graze or be given water.</div>
<div class="li">-Every man must wear uncomfortable clothes made from grain sacks and cry out to Allāh with all his might.</div>
<div class="li">-Don't put ceremonial costumes on any animals, but cover them with grain sacks as well.</div>
<div class="li">-Every one of you must make <span class="wa">tawba</span> by turning away from the evil you are doing. You must stop treating others with cruelty and violence.</div>
<div class="p">Surely if we repent, He will have compassion on us and turn away from His anger so that we will not perish!"</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks7-9"></span><a id="v10"></a>
<div class="p">And when Allāh saw how they repented<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> and believed in Him, and that they stopped their evil ways, He had compassion on them and stopped the calamity that He had threatened to bring on them. He did not destroy them.<span id="bookmarks10"></span></div>
