<div class="mt"><div id="mt1">The story of Yūsuf (a.s.) <span class="dc">"There are lessons in the story of Yūsuf and his brothers for all who seek them"</span>. (<span class="xdc">Yūsuf 12:7</span>)</div></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s1">The dreams of Yūsuf (a.s.) <span class="dc">"We tell you the best of stories in revealing this Qurʾān to you. Before this, you knew nothing about them. Yūsuf said to his father: "Father, I dreamed of eleven stars and the sun and the moon: I saw all of them bow down before me."</span> (<span class="xdc">Yūsuf 12:3-4</span>).</div></div><a id="v3"></a>
<div class="p">Yūsuf was the eleventh son of Yaʿqūb *as. His father loved him more than his other children because Yūsuf had been born to him in his old age.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>Because his father loved him more, his brothers did not like him and so they treated him with hostility. <span class="zv">2 </span> Yūsuf shepherded his father's sheep together with his half-brothers, and whenever he saw or heard that his brothers did something bad, he would come and inform his father. When Yūsuf was 17 years old, <span class="zv">3 </span> Yaʿqūb *as had an expensive multi-colored shirt made for Yūsuf. After this, the brothers stopped saying even one kind word to Yūsuf.<span id="bookmarks4"></span></div><span id="bookmarks4"></span><a id="v5"></a>
<div class="p">One day Yūsuf saw a dream and told his brothers:<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>"I saw a dream last night.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>In my dream all of us were tying up bundles of grain in the field. Then I saw that my bundle got up from the place where it was laying. All your bundles gathered around my bundle and bowed down to it."<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>Then his brothers hated Yūsuf even more: "What?! What are you saying? Do you want to become a king over us now?"<span id="bookmarks8"></span></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p">Soon Yūsuf saw another dream and told his brothers: "I saw a dream again. In my dream the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me."<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>When he told this dream to his father, his father scolded him: "What kind of dream is this? Will I and your mother and your brothers come and bow down before you?"<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>But Yūsuf's dreams made Yaʿqūb (a.s.) think. <span class="dc">"Then he replied, "My son, tell your brothers nothing of this dream, or they may plot to harm you — Shayṭān is man's sworn enemy. Your Lord will choose you, teach you the interpretation of dreams, and perfect his blessing (<span class="wa">niʿma</span>) on you and the people of Yaʿqūb, just as he perfected it earlier on your forefathers Ibrāhīm and Isḥāq"</span> (<span class="xdc">Yūsuf 12:5-6</span>).</div>
<div class="p">\it But Yūsuf had already spoken this dream to his brothers.<span id="bookmarks11"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">The plan of the brothers</div></div>
<div class="p">\it The brothers were envious and began saying:<span class="dc">"Our father loves Yūsuf and Binyāmin more than us, even though we are more numerous, and our father is making a mistake."</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> \it This is why they came to the decision to destroy Yūsuf. So they came to Yaʿqūb (a.s.) and said: <span class="dc">"Oh father, why don't you trust us with Yusuf? We wish him well. Send him with us tomorrow and he will enjoy himself and play — we will take good care of him." He replied, "The thought of you taking him away with you worries me: I am afraid a wolf may eat him when you are not paying attention."</span> (<span class="xdc">Yūsuf 12:11-14</span>).<span id="bookmarks11"></span></div><a id="v12"></a>
<div class="p">Some time passed by. Yūsuf's brothers went to Nāblis to graze the flocks.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>One day Yaʿqūb (a.s.) said to Yūsuf, "Go to Nāblis and see how your brothers are doing. See if they are alright, and if the flocks are okay." Yūsuf agreed and went to Nāblis.<span id="bookmarks13-14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>In the wilderness of Nāblis a man came to him and asked: "What are you looking for?"<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>"I am looking for my brothers," said Yūsuf. "They were grazing sheep. Did you see them?"<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>The man answered, "They are not here. I heard them say they were going to Dūtān." Then Yūsuf went to Dūtān to look for his brothers there.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span><span id="bookmarks17"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">What hatred can do to people...</div></div><span id="bookmarks17"></span><a id="v18"></a>
<div class="p">When the brothers saw Yūsuf from distance, they made a plan to kill him.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>"Here, the dreamer is coming!" they said to each other.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span><span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>"Let us kill him and put him in one of these pits. We'll tell our father that a wolf has eaten him. Then we'll see what becomes of his dreams!"<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>"No," said Raʾūbin, "Do we want to get blood on our hands?<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>It is better if we throw him into the well alive: he will die himself there." Raʾūbin actually wanted to save Yūsuf. He was planning to rescue him later on and take him to his father.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>As soon as Yūsuf came, his brothers captured him and took his multicoloured shirt off.<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>They threw him into an old well which did not have water in it.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span><span id="bookmarks24"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s4">A thought from Yahūdā</div></div><span id="bookmarks24"></span><a id="v25"></a>
<div class="p">After they sat down to eat, they saw a caravan coming in the distance. These were traders from Midyān carrying perfume and spices to Miṣr from Jarash<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-4"><sup>e</sup></span>.<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>Yahūdā said: "What will we gain by killing Yūsuf and hiding what we have done?<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>We should sell him to the Midyāniyyūn. He is our brother, after all." The brothers liked what Yahūdā said.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-5"><sup>f</sup></span> <span class="dc">"Some travellers came by. They sent someone (to the well) to draw water, and he let down his bucket. "Good news!" he exclaimed. "Here is a boy!" They (the brothers) hid him like a piece of merchandise — Allāh was well aware of what they did — and then sold him for a small price, for a few pieces of silver: so little did they value him!"</span> (<span class="xdc">Yūsuf 12:19-20</span>).<span id="bookmarks27"></span></div><span id="bookmarks27"></span><a id="v28"></a>
<div class="p">So they took Yūsuf out of the well and sold him to the traders for 20 silver coins. The traders took Yūsuf with them to Miṣr.<span id="bookmarks28"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s5">A shirt stained with blood</div></div><span id="bookmarks28"></span><a id="v29"></a>
<div class="p">Raʾūbin had not been present when the caravan came. When he arrived, he looked and saw that his brother was not in the well.<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>So he tore the collar (of his robe) in grief and said to his brothers, "Yūsuf is gone, what shall I do now? What will I tell my father?"<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>Then they slaughtered a male goat and dipped<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-6"><sup>g</sup></span> Yūsuf's shirt in its blood.<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>They brought it to their father, saying: "Here, we found this shirt in the wilderness. Do you think it is Yūsuf's shirt?"<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>Yaʿqūb (a.s.) at once recognized the shirt and said, "Yes, this is Yūsuf's shirt, it's Yūsuf's shirt! What? Has he been eaten by a wolf? <span class="dc">"No! Your <span class="wa">nafs</span> has prompted you to do wrong..."</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-7"><sup>h</sup></span><span id="bookmarks33"></span></div><span id="bookmarks33"></span><a id="v34"></a>
<div class="p">Yaʿqūb (a.s.) tore his clothes in grief and dressed himself in sackcloth. He mourned for his son for many days.<span id="bookmarks34"></span> <a id="v35"></a>His sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but it was no use. He would say, <span class="dc">"I plead my grief and sorrow before Allāh. I have knowledge from Allāh that you do not have"</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-8"><sup>i</sup></span> Now I will have this sadness until I enter the grave." Whenever he thought about his son, he would cry bitterly again.<span id="bookmarks35"></span></div><span id="bookmarks35"></span><a id="v36"></a>
<div class="p">The traders came to Miṣr and sold Yūsuf to one of the officials of Firʿawn, to Fūṭīfar, the commander of the Palace guards.<span id="bookmarks36"></span></div>
