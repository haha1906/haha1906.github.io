<div class="s"><div id="s1">Yaʿqūb (a.s.) gets a blessing from his father</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Isḥāq (a.s.) became old and his eyes could not see well.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> And one day he called his oldest son ʿIsāw to himself: "My son!" ʿIsāw said: "Yes sir, my dear father!"<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>"I have became old and I do not know when I will die.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>So take your bow and arrows and go hunt a wild animal for me.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>Then use its meat to make my favorite meal. I want to give the blessing of Allāh to you before I die."<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span></div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks4"></span><span id="bookmarks4"></span><a id="v5"></a>
<div class="p">Ribqah was listening to their conversation. So as soon as ʿIsāw left,<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>she quickly called her younger son Yaʿqūb and said: "My son! Your father just now said to ʿIsāw:<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>"Go hunting and make my favorite meal for me. I want to eat it. Before I die, I want to give you a blessing before Allāh (s.w.t.)."<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>Now listen to my words carefully!<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>Go and quickly bring two fat kid goats from the flock. I will prepare the meal your father loves.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>Then you will take it to your father. He will eat it and before he dies, he will give the blessing to you, not ʿIsāw." <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span></div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Do you remember, long time ago Allāh (s.w.t.) promised Ribqah saying: "You have two nations in your abdomen, and two separate nations will be born from you. One will become stronger and the elder will serve the younger." These two nations are the nations which would come into existence from these two brothers. And the meaning of the phrase "the eldest will serve the younger" means that "the chain of <span class="wa">barakah</span>" will continue through the <span class="wa">nasl</span> of your younger son." For this reason Ribqah became very disturbed after hearing the words of Isḥāq (a.s.). </span></div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks10"></span><span id="bookmarks10"></span><a id="v11"></a>
<div class="p">"Mother," said Yaʿqūb, "my brother's body is hairy, but mine is smooth.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>If my father checks by touching me, I will turn out to be a liar! Then he will curse me instead of blessing me!"<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>"Let that curse fall on my head", said Ribqah. "Do what I say. Go and bring the kid goats."<span id="bookmarks13"></span></div><span id="bookmarks13"></span><a id="v14"></a>
<div class="p">Yaʿqūb brought the kid goats and slaughtered them. Ribqah prepared a meal of Isḥāq's (a.s.) favorite food.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>Then she took the best clothes of ʿIsāw from the house and put them on Yaʿqūb.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>And she covered Yaʿqūb's arms, hands and neck with the skin of the kid goats.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>Then she handed Yaʿqūb the meal and fresh baked bread<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>and send him to his father. "Father!" Yaʿqūb said. "Yes, my son? Who are you?" his father asked, "Are you ʿIsāw or Yaʿqūb?"<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>"This is me, your firstborn son ʿIsāw," said Yaʿqūb to his father, "Here, I brought you a meal from the game meat, so that I could get <span class="wa">duʿā</span> from you. Get up, please, and eat the meal."<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>Isḥāq (a.s.) asked, "How were you able to find it so fast?" Yaʿqūb answered, "Allāh (s.w.t.) put it in my path."<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>His father said, "Come closer, my son, let me touch you. Are you indeed ʿIsāw or not?"<span id="bookmarks21"></span></div><span id="bookmarks21"></span><a id="v22"></a>
<div class="p">Yaʿqūb came near his father. Isḥāq (a.s.) touched him and said: "The voice is Yaʿqūb's, but the hands are ʿIsāw's."<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>Yaʿqūb's hands were covered with the skin, and were hairy like his brother ʿIsāw. This is why Isḥāq (a.s.) thought he was ʿIsāw, but one more time he asked:<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>"Are you really ʿIsāw?" "Yes, I am ʿIsāw," Yaʿqūb answered.<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>After that Isḥāq (a.s.) said: "Bring the meal you cooked. Then I will bless you."<span id="bookmarks25"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">The blessing can be given ONLY one time</div></div>
<div class="p">Hazrat Isḥāq finished eating and drinking and said: <a id="v26"></a>"Come closer, my son, kiss me!"<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>Yaʿqūb came closer and kissed his father. Isḥāq (a.s.) smelled his clothes and blessed him. He said:<span id="bookmarks27"></span></div><span id="bookmarks27"></span><a id="v28"></a>
<div class="p">"The smell of my son is like the smell of the wilderness blessed by Allāh (s.w.t.)!</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="q">May Allāh always shower rain onto your crops,</div>
<div class="q">May your fields be fruitful, your grain plenty and your grapes abundant.<span id="bookmarks28"></span></div><span id="bookmarks28"></span><a id="v29"></a>
<div class="q">May nations serve you, and nationalities obey you.</div>
<div class="q">May you be the head over your brothers,</div>
<div class="q">and may your relatives bow before you.</div>
<div class="q">May those who curse you be cursed,</div>
<div class="q">and those who bless you, find blessings!"</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks29"></span><span id="bookmarks29"></span><a id="v30"></a>
<div class="p">As soon as Yaʿqūb (a.s.) got his father's blessing and left, his brother ʿIsāw returned from hunting.<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>He prepared the meal and went in his father's presence: "Father, sit up, please. I have cooked the meal you like from the game meat. Please eat it and then bless me."<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>"What?! Who are you?" asked Isḥāq. "I am your firstborn son ʿIsāw."<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>Hearing this, Isḥāq (a.s.) became very disturbed. And he said trembling: "And who was it that brought me a meal just now? I have eaten his meal and blessed him. Now the blessing is his."<span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a>Hearing this, ʿIsāw did not know what to do because he was so sad and distressed. Then he started begging, saying: "Father, dear father, please give me a blessing also."<span id="bookmarks34"></span> <a id="v35"></a>Isḥāq (a.s.) said: "Your younger brother took your blessing by tricking me, my child."<span id="bookmarks35"></span> <a id="v36"></a>And ʿIsāw wailed: "He is rightly called Yaʿqūb. He deceived me a second time. First he took my firstborn right. Now he also took my blessing. Did you reserve any blessing for me?"<span id="bookmarks36"></span> <a id="v37"></a>Hazrat Isḥāq said: "I made him the head over you. I said that all his brothers will be his slaves. I provided him with grain and grapes. Now what can I do for you, my son?"<span id="bookmarks37"></span> <a id="v38"></a>ʿIsāw was weeping as he said, "Do you really have only one blessing? Please, bless me too!"<span id="bookmarks38"></span> <a id="v39"></a>Isḥāq (a.s.) said, "You will be deprived of fruitful lands.<span id="bookmarks39"></span> <a id="v40"></a>You will live by your sword and will serve your brother. But if you want to become free, you can break his chains."<span id="bookmarks40"></span></div><span id="bookmarks40"></span><a id="v41"></a>
<div class="p">After that time, ʿIsāw had hatred for Yaʿqūb. So he said to himself: "While my father is alive, I won't say anything. But when the time comes, I will definitely kill him."<span id="bookmarks41"></span></div>
<div class="mt"><div id="mt1">The story of Yaʿqūb (a.s.)</div></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">Starting a journey <span class="dc">"Remember Our servants Ibrāhīm, Isḥāq and Yaʿqūb, all men of strength and vision. We caused them to be devoted to Us through their sincere remembrance of the <span class="wa">ākhira</span>. With Us they will be among the elect, the truly good."</span> (<span class="xdc">Ṣād 38:45-47</span>).<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span></div></div><span id="bookmarks41"></span><a id="v42"></a>
<div class="p">When Ribqah found out what ʿIsāw's plan, she called Yaʿqūb (a.s.) to herself and said: "Your brother wants to kill you.<span id="bookmarks42"></span> <a id="v43"></a>Now you have to go to Ḥārān, to my brother Labān.<span id="bookmarks43"></span> <a id="v44"></a>Stay there until your brother's anger gets less.<span id="bookmarks44"></span> <a id="v45"></a>When he forgets what you did, I will call you myself sending someone there. I do not want to lose both of you in one day!"<span id="bookmarks45"></span> <a id="v46"></a>Then Ribqah went to Hazrat Isḥāq and said: "These al-Ḥittiyyīna daughters in law are making me miserable! I would rather die than see Yaʿqūb marry one of those al-Ḥittiyyīna!"<span id="bookmarks46"></span></div>
