<a id="v1"></a>The Role of Iblīs
<div class="p">\it After that Allāh (s.w.t.) ordered the angels to prostrate themselves before Ādam (a.s.). It is written in Qurʾān al-Karīm: <span class="dc">"We created you, We gave you shape, and then We said to the angels, ‘Bow down before Ādam,’ and they did. But not Iblīs: he was not one of those who bowed down."</span> \it After that Allāh asked Iblīs, <span class="dc">"Why did not you bow down?"</span> and Iblīs answered: <span class="dc">"I am better than him: You created me from fire, and him from clay."</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> <span class="dc">"(Allāh) said, ‘Get down from here! This is no place for your arrogance. Get out! You are contemptible!’ but Iblīs said, ‘Give me respite until the Day people are raised from the dead,’ and Allāh replied, ‘You have respite.’ And then Iblīs said, ‘Because You have put me in the wrong, I will lie in wait for them all on Your straight path: I will come at them– from their front and their back, from their right and their left– and You will find that most of them are ungrateful.’"</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Aʿrāf 7:11-17</span>).</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">This is how Iblīs became an enemy of humankind. </span><span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span><span id="bookmarks1"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s1">Temptation from Shayṭān <span class="dc">We said, ‘Ādam, live with your wife in this garden. Both of you eat freely there as you will, but do not go near this tree, or you will both become wrongdoers.’</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Baqara 2:35</span>)</div></div>
<div class="p"><span class="zv">1 </span>One day Shayṭān came to Ḥawwāʾ in the shape of a snake and asked: "Did Allāh indeed say not to eat from the fruit of any tree of the garden?"<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span><span id="bookmarks1"></span></div><a id="v2"></a>
<div class="p">"We can eat the fruit of any tree in the garden," said the woman.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>"Allāh made only one tree haraam for us. He said: 'Do not eat from the fruit of it, and do not even touch it, otherwise you will die.'"<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>"No, you won't die," said Shayṭān to woman. "Allāh said this to you for a reason:<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>If you eat the fruit of this tree, your eyes will open. Then you will be like Allāh, and you will be able to tell the difference between good and evil".<span id="bookmarks5"></span></div><span id="bookmarks5"></span><a id="v6"></a>
<div class="p">The woman could not take her eyes away from the fruit. The fruit looked very beautiful and seemed very delicious. She said to herself, "If I eat it, I will have knowledge." And so she picked the fruit and ate it. Then she gave it to her husband who was standing beside her, and he also ate it.<span id="bookmarks6"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Leaving the Straight/Right Path <span class="dc">"Ādam disobeyed his Lord and was led astray."</span> (<span class="xdc">Tāʾ Hāʾ 20:121</span>)</div></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Shayṭān wanted to call Allāh a liar. He told Ḥawwāʾ that Allāh said this to her for a reason. "Oh," thought Ḥawwāʾ. That means that there are some things that Allāh doesn't want us to know!"</span></div>
<div class="p">\it Shayṭān was giving here this temptation: "If you eat from the fruit of this tree, you will be like Allāh. How long do you want to live in ignorance? Do not you want to know what is good and what is evil?" This was the message in the words of Shayṭān. Then what did Hawwa think? She probably thought, "So, if Allāh is hiding this from us, then He does not love us!"</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">So, what should we do if Allāh is not giving something to us? Should we try to get it with our own power? Shayṭān's tempatation was: "Take it, take it, do not be afraid! If you trust Allāh, you will end up with nothing!" So up until this time in the story, our first father and mother were relying on Allāh, believing Him and asking Him for guidance. But now they decided to live independently — living without involving Allāh in their lives.</span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">As a result .... <span class="dc">(Shayṭān) lured them with lies. Their nakedness became exposed to them when they had eaten from the tree: they began to put together leaves from the Garden to cover themselves.</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Aʿrāf 7:22</span>).</div></div><span id="bookmarks6"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p">Immediately the eyes of both of them were opened and they suddenly realized that they were naked, so they made coverings for themselves from the fig leaves.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>In the afternoon, when the evening breeze was blowing, they heard the sound of Allāh. Both of them <span class="it">fell into panic, and </span> they ran and hid themselves among the trees. <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span><span id="bookmarks8"></span></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p">"Where are you?" called Allāh (s.w.t.).<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>"I was afraid when I heard you coming," said Ādam (a.s.), "because I am naked."<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>"Who told you that you are naked?" said Allāh to Hazrat Ādam. "Or did you eat the fruit that I told you not to eat?"<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>Ādam (a.s.) answered, "The woman You gave to me, she gave that fruit to me. Then I ate it".<span id="bookmarks12"></span></div><span id="bookmarks12"></span><a id="v13"></a>
<div class="p">Then Allāh said to Ḥawwāʾ: "What have you done?" "The snake tricked me, and then I ate it", said Ḥawwāʾ.<span id="bookmarks13"></span></div><span id="bookmarks13"></span><a id="v14"></a>
<div class="p">Allāh spoke to the snake: "Because of what you have done, you will be the most cursed among the animals. All of your life you will crawl on your stomach and you will eat dust.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>I will make you and the woman, your <span class="wa">zurriyya</span> and her zurriyya mutual enemies. You will strike his heel, and he will crush your head."<span id="bookmarks15"></span></div><span id="bookmarks15"></span><a id="v16"></a>
<div class="p">Then Allāh (s.w.t.) said to the woman: "From now on, you will bear children with great suffering and much pain. From now on, you will always be attracted toward your husband, but he will rule over you".<span id="bookmarks16"></span></div><span id="bookmarks16"></span><a id="v17"></a>
<div class="p">Then He said to Ādam (a.s.): "Because you listened to your wife and ate the fruit I had made haraam, the earth will be cursed. From now on, all of your life, you will only get food by working hard.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>The earth will grow thorns and will make life difficult for you.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>You will sweat as you work all your life to earn a living. Eventually you will return to the soil. Because you were taken from the soil, you will become soil once again".</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">So we see that because of sin, this curse entered the world.</span><span id="bookmarks19"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s4">Sent Away <span class="dc">"But Satan made them slip, and removed them from the state they were in. We said, ‘Get out, all of you! You are each other’s enemy. On earth you will have a place to stay and livelihood for a time.’"</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Baqara 2:36</span>)</div></div><span id="bookmarks19"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p">Then Allāh (s.w.t.) made clothes out of animal skins and put the clothes on them. He said:<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>"Humans were hasty and wanted to know good and evil, like We do, before it was time for them. Now We will not let them live eternally by eating from the Tree of Life.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>Let them go and labor on the soil." Then He sent them out<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-4"><sup>e</sup></span> of the garden, and <span class="it">removed them from living in His presence.</span><span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>And He appointed creatures called Karub as guards at the door of the garden. A sword of fire that moved in all directions was guarding the road.</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Because of sin people were removed from living in the presence of Allāh. Only life with Allāh can be called "TRULY HAPPY LIFE". Then what do we call life without Allah?</span><span id="bookmarks24"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s5">Can we call it DEATH?</div></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">That is right. The word "death" indeed expresses "separation". When a man dies, he is separated or removed from his relatives and from his family. But the worst death is when one is separated from Allāh, removed from the presence of Allāh. It was for good reason that Allāh said "...if you eat from it, you will die on that same day."</span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s6">So what actually happened?</div></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">You may think: "Okay, so what happened, really?" Well, if sin did not happen, we would not have been sent away from the presence of Allāh. But now there is a wall between us and Allāh.</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">If there was no sin, we would not have diseases or death. Allāh did not create Ādam just so he would become ill or to die after a few years.</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">If there was no sin, we would not have frustration, offence, misunderstanding or hatred between people. Allāh created human beings so that they would be merciful and loving to each other, and so they would have have pure good relationships.</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Look around you. None of the bad things you see were there at the beginning. Allāh created humanity to have a beautiful life, to have true life. But because of sin, the world has changed.</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Allāh also created us so that we would take care of the earth. But now people are doing the opposite: The earth is being polluted, the water is being poisoned, and the air is getting dirty... People are not living for Allāh: They are not living the way Allāh wants.</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">The worst thing is, humanity was removed from Allāh's presence. We were driven out — driven out of the presence of Allāh.</span> <span class="dc">"Then Ādam received some words from his Lord and He accepted his repentance: He is the Ever Relenting, the Most Merciful. We said, ‘Get out, all of you! But when guidance comes from Me, as it certainly will, there will be no fear for those who follow My guidance nor will they grieve."</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Baqara 2:37-38</span>)</div>
