<div class="s"><div id="s1">The fifth plague</div></div><a id="v2"></a>
<div class="p">The next plague was an epidemic disease that afflicted the animals. Allāh (s.w.t.) a athe message to the Firʿawn through nabī Mūsā, saying: "If you keep refusing to let My people go, I will send a disease on your domestic animals."<span id="bookmarks2-3"></span> <a id="v6"></a>But Firʿawn did not obey. As a result, the animals of the Miṣriyyūn became sick and their camels, horses and donkeys, cattles and sheep died. But nothing happened to the livestock of the ʿIbrāniyyūn.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v4"></a>Allāh had warned Firʿawn on this occasion also, saying: "Tomorrow I will send a plague on your livestock, but none of the animals of Banī Isrāʾīl will die."<span id="bookmarks4-5"></span></div><span id="bookmarks4-5"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p">Firʿawn sent officials to check whether or not the animals of the ʿIbrāniyyūn had died. After he realized it was true, he made his heart hard again, and did not obey Allāh (s.w.t.).<span id="bookmarks7"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">The sixth plague</div></div><span id="bookmarks7"></span><a id="v8"></a>
<div class="p">After that Allāh (s.w.t.) said to Mūsā and Hārūn (a.s.): "Take a handful ashes and go to Firʿawn. Have Mūsā throw the ashes into the air while Firʿawn watches.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>The ash will go up in the air and will spread all over Miṣr. Ulcers with pus will appear on the bodies of the people and the animals."<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>And that is what happened. Mūsā and Hārūn (a.s.) took ash from a stove, went to Firʿawn and threw the ash into the air. The disease of ulcers came on the people and on the animals, too.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>This time the magicians of Miṣr could not even come out to challenge Mūsā (a.s.), because like the others, they also had the ulcerous disease all over their bodies.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>Even so, Firʿawn did not listen to the rasul of Allāh.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span><span id="bookmarks12"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">The seventh plague</div></div><span id="bookmarks12"></span><a id="v13"></a>
<div class="p">"Tomorrow go to Firʿawn again," said Allāh (s.w.t.). "Tell him, our God says this:<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v15"></a>'I could have destroyed you long ago, and your people as well.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>But have I kept you (plural) alive until now in order to demonstrate My power to all the earth.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>How long will you keep my people in Miṣr? If you are still determined go against Me,<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v14"></a>you will suffer from more plagues.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v18"></a>Tomorrow at this time I will send a terrible hailstorm on you.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>Tell your people to take their animals from the fields and put them under shelter. Otherwise, you can be certain that this time all the people left in the open and all animals will be destroyed.'"<span id="bookmarks19"></span></div><span id="bookmarks19"></span><a id="v20"></a>
<div class="p">After this warning, the servants of Firʿawn who had fear of Allāh (s.w.t.) put their people and animals under shelters.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>But those who had no fear left their slaves and animals in the field.<span id="bookmarks21"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s4">Hail rains down</div></div><span id="bookmarks21"></span><a id="v22"></a>
<div class="p">Allāh (s.w.t.) said to nabī Mūsā, "Stretch your hand towards the sky. Hail will rain everywhere in the land of Miṣr, on the people, on the animals and on all the plants that are growing."<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>Hazrat Mūsā raised his staff to the sky. The thunder roared and lightning started flashing. The Miṣriyyūn had not seen such heavy hail in all the history of Miṣr.<span id="bookmarks23-24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>Everything left in the open space -- all people and animals -- everything died. The grass was ruined. Even the trees were destroyed.<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>The only place where it did not hail was the land of al-Sadīr where Banī Isrāʾīl lived.</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Have you ever noticed that whatever Allāh (s.w.t.) commands us, He does it for our benefit? Here, in this situation also, Allāh (s.w.t.) had commanded them to put their animals under shelter. Those who listened to the command obeyed it. But those who did not pay attention, lost out. This is what happens when we do not pay attention to what Allāh (s.w.t.) says. Allāh (s.w.t.) gives His instructions to us for our benefit. If we do not pay attention to His instructions, we will actually be doing evil to ourselves. In the end, we punish ourselves. The same is true about our final destiny: if we do not choose Allāh (s.w.t.)'s path here and now, it means that we have chosen to live without Allāh (s.w.t.) in the next life also. Those who do not want to be with Allāh (s.w.t.) on the earth, will not be with Him in the afterlife either.</span><span id="bookmarks26"></span></div><span id="bookmarks26"></span><span id="bookmarks26"></span><a id="v27"></a>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">After that Firʿawn called Mūsā and Hārūn (a.s.) to his presence and said: "I am guilty. Allāh is right; I and my people are wrong.<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>Tell your Ilāh to stop the thunder and hail. I will let you go, so you do not need to stay here any longer".<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>Nabī Mūsā answered, "As soon as I leave the city, I will pray to Allāh (s.w.t.). The thunder and the hail will stop. Then you will know that all the earth belongs to Allāh.<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>But I know that you and your officials are still not have fear of Allāh (s.w.t.)".<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>(The hail completely ruined the barley and the flax, because at that time the barley was growing heads, and the flax was blooming.<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>But the white wheat and the red wheat did not get harmed, because they ripen later.)<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>Mūsā (a.s.) left the city and prayed. The thunder, the hail and the rain stopped.<span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a>When Firʿawn and his palace officials saw this, they again chose the road of stubbornness. The hardened their hearts and did not let Banī Isrāʾīl go.<span id="bookmarks34-35"></span></div><span id="bookmarks34-35"></span>
