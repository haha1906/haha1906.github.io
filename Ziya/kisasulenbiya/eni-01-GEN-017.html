<div class="s"><div id="s1">The sign of the Covenant made with Hazrat Ibrāhīm</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">About 13 years of time passed after that. One day Allāh (huwa ʿalā kull shayʾin <span class="wa">qadīr</span>) gave a revelation to Ibrāhīm (a.s.) again and said: "Ibrāhīm, be loyal (wafāʿ) to our covenant, value our friendship, and live with <span class="wa">taqwā</span>.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>I will always be with you and protect you. I will increase your descendants very much."<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>Ibrāhīm (a.s.) did <span class="wa">sajda</span>. Allāh said,<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>"You will be the father of many nationalities.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span><span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v6"></a>I will create many children and nations out of you. Kings will be born from among your descendants.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>My covenant will continue with you and with your descendants from generation to generation.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>This earth/land, where you are a visitor/stranger now, I will give to you and to your descendants as everlasting <span class="wa">mulk</span> (possession). You (plural, i.e. your descendants) will be under My protection."<span id="bookmarks8"></span></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p">"Just keep My covenant: you and also your children be faithful to My covenant always.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>Every male among you must have his foreskin circumcised.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>This will be the sign of the covenant between us.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>Circumcise the male children when they are eight days old. You will also circumcise your slaves, whether you buy them from foreign nations or whether they are born among you.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>This sign on your bodies is the proof/argument that the covenant I made with you will last forever.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>If anybody among you does not want to be circumcised, you must remove them from your community, because by doing this he has rejected My covenant."<span id="bookmarks14"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Isḥāq means "he laughs" <span class="dc">"We gave Ibrāhīm the good news of Isḥāq– a prophet and a righteous <span class="wa">saliḥ</span> man– and blessed him and Isḥāq too."</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Ṣaffāt 37:112-113</span>).</div></div><span id="bookmarks14"></span><a id="v15"></a>
<div class="p">Allāh (s.w.t.) continued speaking and said, "You will not call your wife Sarāy<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> anymore. From now on her name is Sārah.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>I will bless her and surely give you a son by her. She will be the mother of many nations. Kings will be born from among her descendants." <span class="it">(The word "<span class="it">Sārah</span>" means "queen".) </span><span id="bookmarks16"></span></div><span id="bookmarks16"></span><a id="v17"></a>
<div class="p">Ibrāhīm did <span class="wa">sajda</span>. And these thoughts went through his heart: 'I am 100 years old. And Sārah is 90 years old.' He laughed to himself, and he thought: "Will Sārah really bear a child now at this age?"<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>Then he said: "Oh Allāh, please bless my son Ismāʿīl!" <span class="zv">21</span> Allāh said, "Ibrāhīm! Next year Sārah will bear you a son.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>You will name him Isḥāq.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span> I will continue the covenant I made with you, through this son of yours."<span id="bookmarks19"></span></div><span id="bookmarks19"></span><a id="v20"></a>
<div class="p">"Have peaceful mind about Ismāʿīl", Allāh said afterwards. "I will surely bless him. I will increase his descendants and I will create a big nation out of him. He will be the father of twelve kings."<span id="bookmarks20"></span></div><span id="bookmarks20"></span><a id="v23"></a>
<div class="p">On that very day, Hazrat Ibrāhīm obeyed Allāh's command: he circumcised all men and male children who were born in his house or whom he had bought.<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>At that time Ibrāhīm (a.s.) was 99 years old,<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>and Ismāʿīl (a.s.) was thirteen.<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>In this way, Hazrat Ibrāhīm, Ismāʿīl (a.s.),<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>and their servants--all males born in his house or bought--were circumcised on that very day.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span><span id="bookmarks27"></span></div>
