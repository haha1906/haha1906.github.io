<a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">If someone steals someone's ox and sells it or slaughters it, he should pay back five oxen for each ox stolen, and four sheep for each sheep stolen.<span id="bookmarks1"></span></div><span id="bookmarks1"></span><a id="v2"></a>
<div class="p">If the stolen animal is caught alive, he must pay back double the value of the animal. If he can not pay it, sell the thief himself as a slave.</div>
<div class="p">If a thief is struck and killed while he was breaking into somebody's house at night, the man who kills him is not guilty of murder, but if this killing happens during daytime, the man who kills him will be considered a murderer.<span id="bookmarks2-4"></span></div><span id="bookmarks2-4"></span><a id="v5"></a>
<div class="p">If someone allows his animal to go into a field or garden and damage someone else's crops, the owner of the animal should pay him from the best of his own fruit or crops.<span id="bookmarks5"></span></div><span id="bookmarks5"></span><a id="v6"></a>
<div class="p">If someone starts a fire, and it happens that someone else's harvest or crops are burned unexpectedly, the man who started the fire should pay restitution for it.<span id="bookmarks6"></span></div><span id="bookmarks6"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p">If you give money or things to someone as <span class="wa">amāna</span> (for safekeeping) and a thief steals it, when the thief is found, he must pay back double.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>If the thief is not found, then the owner of the house must swear before Allāh (s.w.t.) saying: "I did not do <span class="wa">khiyāna</span> to the amāna."<span id="bookmarks8"></span></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v10"></a>
<div class="p">Suppose you give your ox or donkey or sheep or another animal to someone as amana, and the animal dies or gets hurt or is stolen, but there is no witness.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>In that case, the neighbour must swear before Allāh saying: “I did not do khiyana to your animal”. The owner of the animal should accept his oath and no restitution for the animal is required.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>But if the animal was stolen, he must pay restitution.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>If however it was eaten by a wild animal, he must show the remains of the dead animal as evidence. Restitution does not need to be paid in this case either.<span id="bookmarks13"></span></div><span id="bookmarks13"></span><a id="v14"></a>
<div class="p">If you borrow someone's animal and it gets an injury or dies, you (plural) must pay restitution for the animal.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>But if the owner of the animal was present when it got the injury, the restitution no restitution needs to be paid. If the animal was rented, then the money you paid for the rent covers the loss or harm.<span id="bookmarks15"></span></div><span id="bookmarks15"></span><a id="v16"></a>
<div class="p">If a man seduces a virgin who is not engaged, he must pay the dowry for her and marry her.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>But if the girl's father refuses to give his daughter to him, he must still pay the dowry given for virgins as a restitution.<span id="bookmarks17"></span></div><span id="bookmarks17"></span><a id="v18"></a>
<div class="p">Death is the punishment for those who practice magic.<span id="bookmarks18"></span></div><span id="bookmarks18"></span><a id="v19"></a>
<div class="p">Anyone who has sexual relations with an animal is worthy of death.<span id="bookmarks19"></span></div><span id="bookmarks19"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p">Do not treat foreigners badly and do not oppress them. Remember that you also were once foreigners in Miṣr.<span id="bookmarks21"></span></div><span id="bookmarks21"></span><a id="v22"></a>
<div class="p">Do not mistreat widows or orphans.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>If you do, they will cry out to me and I will definitely listen to their cry,<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>and will be angry against you. Then your wives will become widows, your children will become orphans. So do not hurt them.</div>
<div class="p"><span class="zv">Deu 15:7 </span> Be kind and generous towards any of your brothers who are poor. Do not be mean and selfısh. <span class="zv">Deu 15:8 </span> If they come asking for a loan, give them enough to cover their need.<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>Do not charge interest like a moneylender.</div>
<div class="p"><span class="zv">Deu 15:10 </span> Give generously to the poor, not grudgingly, because then Allāh (s.w.t.) will bless your work.<span id="bookmarks25"></span></div><span id="bookmarks25"></span><a id="v26"></a>
<div class="p">If you take someone's robe as a pledge, give it back before sunset.<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>This coat may be his only covering to keep warm. If so, then how can he sleep without a covering? I will listen to him when he cries out to me, because I am God of mercy and compassion.<span id="bookmarks27"></span></div><span id="bookmarks27"></span><a id="v28"></a>
<div class="p">Do not speak bad words against Allāh (s.w.t.). Do not curse the leaders of the nation.<span id="bookmarks28"></span></div><span id="bookmarks28"></span>
