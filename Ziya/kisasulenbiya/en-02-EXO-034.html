Early in the morning come up to My presence, to the mountain Saynāʾ," He said.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v4"></a>Mūsā (a.s.) prepared the tablets and the next day early in the morning he got up and went up to the mountain Saynāʾ— to the presence of Allāh (s.w.t.).<span id="bookmarks4"></span></div><span id="bookmarks4"></span><a id="v5"></a>
<div class="p">Allāh (s.w.t.) descended to the mountain in a bright cloud.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>As He passed near Mūsā (a.s.), He said: "I am Allāh, Allāh, raḥmān and raḥīm, slow to anger, God who is rich to love and faithfulness.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span><span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>All of those who love Me, will find mercy and their sins will be forgiven.

After forty days<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>he came down to the people with the tablets where the covenant-book was written. His face was shining because he spoke with Allāh (s.w.t.). But he himself was not aware of it.<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>The people were afraid to come close to him, seeing the light coming from his face.<span id="bookmarks30"></span></div><span id="bookmarks30"></span><a id="v31"></a>
<div class="p">Nabī Mūsā called them to himself.<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>Then he told them all the laws that Allāh had given.<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>After he finished speaking, he covered his face with a veil.<span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a>So, whenever he went to the presence of Allāh (s.w.t.), he would take the veil from his face, then coming to Banī Isrāʾīl he would explain the commandments he got from Allāh.<span id="bookmarks34"></span> <a id="v35"></a>During each conversation the nation of Isrāʾīl witnessed that his face was shining. Then Mūsā (a.s.) would put a veil again on his face until he went to the presence of Allāh (s.w.t.).<span id="bookmarks35"></span></div>

When they worship their gods, they will call you also to engage in idolatry. Then you will betray Me, and repeat the things they are doing.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>If you take their girls to your sons, your sons will turn their faces away from Me and will give their hearts to the idols that their wives worship."<span id="bookmarks16"></span></div><span id="bookmarks16"></span>
