<div class="p">Hazrat Yūsuf wept and threw himself on his father. He hugged and kissed his face.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>Then he called doctors to embalm the corpse.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>(It would take 40 days in Miṣr to embalm a corpse.) They mourned 70 days in Miṣr for Yaʿqūb (a.s.)<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>When the days of mourning were over, Yūsuf (a.s.) said to Firʿawn's officials,<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>"Please go and tell Firʿawn for me: my father made me swear an oath and told me, 'when I die, bury me in the place where my ancestors are in Kanʿān.' Now if you give me permission, I want to take my father and bury him. After the burial I will return."<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>Firʿawn agreed and said, "Let him go, let him fulfil the promise he had given to his father."<span id="bookmarks6"></span></div><span id="bookmarks6"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p">So Hazrat Yūsuf and his brothers took their families and went on the journey to bury their father.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>(All the young children and animals were left in al-Sadīr.)<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>All the officials of Firʿawn and well-known people of Miṣr also went with them. A big caravan consisting of chariots, horsemen and people went on a journey to Kanʿān.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>When they came to the other side of the river al-Ardūn, to the threshing place of ʿAwsaj, they mourned and wept for 7 days.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>The people who lived in ʿAwsaj saw the mourning and named that place Ḥuzn al-Miṣriyyīn (which means, 'the mourning of the Miṣriyyūn'), saying, "The Miṣriyyūn mourned greatly here."<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>The sons of Hazrat Yaʿqūb fulfilled the will of their father:<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>they took him to Kanʿān and buried him in the cave of al-Muḍāʿafah near Mamrā.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>Then all of them returned to Miṣr.<span id="bookmarks14"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s1">The Brothers Worry</div></div><span id="bookmarks14"></span><a id="v15"></a>
<div class="p">After the death of their father, the brothers of Yūsuf (a.s.) started worrying, saying: "What if Yūsuf is keeping a grudge in his heart! Will he take revenge from us now?!"<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>Then they sent a message to Hazrat Yūsuf saying: "Before our father died, he gave these instructions: Tell Yūsuf that even though his brothers did evil to him, he should forgive their sin.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>Please, forgive us! We are also slaves of Allāh whom our father worshipped!" Hearing this, Hazrat Yūsuf's eyes were filled with tears.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>Then the brothers came themselves and fell before Yūsuf's feet saying, "We are your slaves."<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>Yūsuf said: "Why are you afraid of me? Am I Allāh<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> to judge you or punish you?<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>It is true that you wanted to do evil to me, but Allāh turned your evil intention into something good. He raised me to this position in order to save many many people's lives.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>Do not be afraid. I will take care of you myself, and your children as well." After this, the brothers' hearts calmed down.<span id="bookmarks21"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Yūsuf's (a.s.) Death <span class="dc">"My Rabb! You have given me authority; You have taught me to interpret dreams. Creator of the heavens and the earth! You are my protector (<span class="wa">Waliy </span>) in this world and in the Hereafter. Let me die a Muslim (in true devotion to you). Join me to the righteous (<span class="wa">ṣāliḥīn</span>)."</span> (<span class="xdc">Yūsuf 12:101</span>).</div></div><span id="bookmarks21"></span><a id="v22"></a>
<div class="p">Hazrat Yūsuf and his brothers stayed in Miṣr. Yūsuf (a.s.) lived to the age of 110.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>He lived long enough to see the sons and grandchildren of Ifrāyim and the sons of Mākhīr son of Minashshih.<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>Before he died, he said to his brothers: "My death is near. But Allāh will surely help you. He will take you to the land He had promised to our fathers Ibrāhīm, Isḥāq and Yaʿqūb."<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>Then he made them swear an oath, and he said, "When Allāh takes you back to Kanʿān, take my bones with you also."<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>So Yūsuf (a.s.) died at the age of 110. After he died, they embalmed his corpse and put it in a chest in Miṣr.</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p">\it The <span class="wa">Sūra</span> of Yūsuf in the Qurʾān al-Karīm finishes like this: <span class="dc">"This account is part of what was beyond your knowledge. We revealed it to you: you were not present with Yūsuf's brothers when they made their treacherous plans. However eagerly you may want them to, most men will not believe... There are many signs in the heavens and the earth that they pass by and give no heed to – most of them will only believe in Allāh while also joining others with Him. Are they so sure that an overwhelming punishment from Allāh will not fall on them, or that the Last Hour will not come upon them suddenly when they least expect it?"</span> \it (<span class="xdc">Yūsuf 12:102-103, 105-107</span>).<span id="bookmarks26"></span></div>
