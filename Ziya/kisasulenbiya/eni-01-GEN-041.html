<div class="s"><div id="s1">Firʿawn's dreams<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span></div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">After two years, Firʿawn saw a dream.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>In his dream he was standing by the river al-Nīl. Suddenly seven fat, healthy cows came out of the river and started grazing along the bank among the reeds.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>After them, seven ugly, skinny cows came out of the river, went up to the fat cows,<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>and ate them. At this point Firʿawn woke up.<span id="bookmarks4"></span></div><span id="bookmarks4"></span><a id="v5"></a>
<div class="p">A little later, he went to sleep and saw another dream. In this dream, seven full heads of grain grew up on a single stalk.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>After that, seven other heads of grain grew out, but they were thin and scorched by the eastern wind.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>Then those heads with thin grains swallowed up the full heads. At this point Firʿawn woke up again and realized that it had been a dream.<span id="bookmarks7"></span></div><span id="bookmarks7"></span><a id="v8"></a>
<div class="p">These dreams bothered Firʿawn very much. The next morning he called for all the magicians and wise men of Miṣr to come. But no-one could interpret his dreams.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>Then the butler of Firʿawn said: "Your Majesty, I must confess today that I have done something wrong.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>Once you were angry with me and with the baker and you threw us into prison.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>When we were in prison, one night we both had dreams. Our dreams had different interpretations.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>There was a young ʿIbrāniy fellow in the prison - a slave of the commander of the guards. We told our dreams to this fellow. He interpreted them.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>After three days what he had said was fulfilled exactly: I was restored to my previous position, and the baker was hanged on a pole." \it Then he said: <span class="dc">"Send me, I will tell you the meaning of this."</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span>, \it and he came to the prison, to Yūsuf (a.s.) and then came back to Firʿawn and gave him the report.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>Firʿawn sent men to the prison saying: "Bring Yūsuf (a.s.)."<span id="bookmarks14"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Yūsuf (a.s.) in the presence of Firʿawn <span class="dc">"When the messenger came to fetch Yūsuf, he said: "Go back to your master and ask him about what happened to the women who cut their hands... [This was] for my master to know that I did not betray him behind his back."</span> (<span class="xdc">Yūsuf 12:50,52</span>).</div></div>
<div class="p">\it Because of that the "crime" of Yūsuf (a.s.) was investigated again, and it was proven that he was without blame.</div>
<div class="p">After that they brought Hazrat Yūsuf quickly from prison. After he had shaved and changed his clothes, he went into the presence of Firʿawn.<span id="bookmarks14"></span></div><a id="v15"></a>
<div class="p">"I had a dream," said Firʿawn to him. "But no-one can interpret my dream. They say you are able to interpret dreams when you hear them."<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>"I cannot do this myself," Hazrat Yūsuf said to Firʿawn, "But Allāh can interpret your dream and make your heart peaceful."<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>Then Firʿawn told him the dream he had: "In my dream I was standing on the bank of the river al-Nīl.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>Suddenly seven fat, healthy cows came out of the river and started grazing among the reeds along the bank.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>Behind them, seven more ugly, skinny cows came out from the river. I have not seen such bad-looking cows anywhere in Miṣr.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>Then the skinny cows ate the seven fat cows which had come out previously.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>But even after eating them, they looked just as bad as before. Then I woke up.<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>In a little while, I saw another dream. In my dream there were seven good heads with full grains growing out of one stalk.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>Then seven more heads grew up. They were scorched from the eastern wind,<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>with thin grains. And they ate the heads that had full grains. These are the dreams I had. I told them to the magicians, but none of them could interpret them."<span id="bookmarks24"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">The interpretation of the dreams</div></div><span id="bookmarks24"></span><a id="v25"></a>
<div class="p">Yūsuf (a.s.) said to Firʿawn, "Your Majesty, both of your dreams have one meaning. Allāh has made it known to you in advance what He is going to do.<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>The seven good cows and seven good heads are the sign of seven prosperous years.<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>The seven ugly, skinny cows and the seven shriveled heads that come after them is an indicator of a famine that will continue for seven years.<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>Allāh has shown to you what He is going to do in this land:<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>for seven years Miṣr will have an abundant harvest.<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>But then for the next seven years, there will be such a bad famine<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>that everybody will forget the years of abundance.<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>The fact that the dream has been repeated twice means, that Allāh had decided to do this, and will do it soon.<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>Your Majesty, you now find a wise man and put him responsible over the lands of Miṣr.<span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a>Then send special supervisors all over the country. They should take one fifth of the harvests in Miṣr during the good seven years and store them in the cities.<span id="bookmarks34-35"></span> <a id="v36"></a>During the following seven years of famine you will use this stored grain. Otherwise Miṣr will be destroyed because of the famine."<span id="bookmarks36"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s4">Yūsuf (a.s.) gets a new position <span class="dc">Once (Firʿawn) had spoken with (Yūsuf), he said: "From now on you will have our trust and favour."</span> (<span class="xdc">Yūsuf, 12:54</span>).</div></div><span id="bookmarks36"></span><a id="v37"></a>
<div class="p">The king of Miṣr and the palace officials liked the words of Yūsuf (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks37"></span> <a id="v38"></a>Then Firʿawn said to his officials: "Who do you think can do this work better than Yusuf? It is obvious that Allāh has filled him with the spirit of wisdom!"<span id="bookmarks38"></span> <a id="v39"></a>Then he said to Yūsuf (a.s.): "Since Allāh has revealed all this to you, then there is nobody wiser or smarter than you.<span id="bookmarks39"></span> <a id="v40"></a>You will be responsible for this yourself. Starting today, you will be my right hand deputy. From now on, everybody except me will obey you.<span id="bookmarks40"></span> <a id="v41"></a>All Miṣr will obey you. You will now govern the kingdom!"<span id="bookmarks41"></span> <a id="v42"></a>Then he took his royal ring from his finger, and put it on Yūsuf (a.s.)'s finger. He gave him nice clothes to wear made from fine linen, and put a gold chain around his neck.<span id="bookmarks42"></span> <a id="v43"></a>Then he put him on the second royal chariot. Wherever Hazrat Yūsuf (a.s.) went, announcers were shouting in front of his chariot: "Bow down, bow down!".<span id="bookmarks43"></span> <a id="v44"></a>So Firʿawn appointed Hazrat Yūsuf as head over all Miṣr,<span id="bookmarks44"></span> <a id="v45"></a>and married him to a daughter of one of his officials.<span id="bookmarks45"></span> <a id="v46"></a>At that time Yūsuf (a.s.) was 30 years old. <span class="dc">"In this way We settled Yūsuf in that land to live wherever he wished."</span> (<span class="xdc">Yūsuf, 12:56</span>).<span id="bookmarks46"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s5">The years of abundance</div></div><span id="bookmarks46"></span><a id="v47"></a>
<div class="p">The years of abundance started. For seven years the harvest was good and plenty everywhere.<span id="bookmarks47"></span> <a id="v48"></a>Every year Hazrat Yūsuf took one fifth of the harvest, and set it aside and stored it in the cities.<span id="bookmarks48"></span> <a id="v49"></a>The grain being stored was so much that eventually Yūsuf (a.s.) stopped counting it.<span id="bookmarks49"></span></div><span id="bookmarks49"></span><a id="v50"></a>
<div class="p">During those years, Hazrat Yūsuf's wife bore two sons.<span id="bookmarks50"></span> <a id="v51"></a>Yūsuf (a.s.) named his oldest son Minashshih, saying "Because I lost my family, Allāh filled the emptiness by giving me a family, and has made me forget the difficulties I had in my life."<span id="bookmarks51"></span> <a id="v52"></a>He named his second son Ifrāyim, saying "Allāh gave success in my difficult life spent in a foreign land."<span id="bookmarks52"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s6">The Famine Starts</div></div><span id="bookmarks52"></span><a id="v53"></a>
<div class="p">Finally, the period of seven years of abundance came to an end. As Yūsuf (a.s.) had said,<span id="bookmarks53"></span> <a id="v54"></a>the seven years of famine started. There was a famine in the surrounding countries also.<span id="bookmarks54"></span> <a id="v55"></a>As the famine affected Miṣr, the people of Miṣr came to Firʿawn asking for help. Firʿawn told them: "Go to Yūsuf. Do what he says."<span id="bookmarks55"></span> <a id="v56"></a>So, when the famine spread everywhere in Miṣr, Hazrat Yūsuf opened the storehouses and started selling grain to the Miṣriyyūn.<span id="bookmarks56"></span> <a id="v57"></a>When other nations heard that there was grain in Miṣr, they started coming to Yūsuf (a.s.), because the famine was so bad in those places as well.<span id="bookmarks57"></span></div>
