<a id="v1"></a>The Death of Ibrāhīm (a.s.)<span id="bookmarks1"></span><span id="bookmarks1"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p">Hazrat Ibrāhīm died at the age of 175<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span><span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>after living a long and satisfying life.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>His sons Isḥāq and Ismāʿīl buried him in the cave of al-Muḍāʿafah near Mamrā, at the field of ʿEfrūn, the son of Ṣuḥar the Ḥittiyyīn,<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>next to where Sārah was buried. Ibrāhīm (a.s.) had bought this land from the al-Ḥittiyyūn.</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks10"></span><span id="bookmarks10"></span><a id="v11"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="it">What choices did Ibrāhīm (a.s.) make during his lifetime? </span><span id="bookmarks11"></span></div><span id="bookmarks11"></span><a id="v12"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="it">When Allāh told him to leave his father's house and go to the land He would show him, he obeyed Allāh. </span><span id="bookmarks12"></span></div><span id="bookmarks12"></span><span id="bookmarks12"></span><a id="v14"></a>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Because he believed completely in Allāh's goodness, he took his son to sacrifice him.</span></div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks14"></span>

<div class="s"><div id="s1">Ribqah becomes pregnant <span class="dc">"Some of their (Ibrāhīm and Isḥāq's) <span class="wa">zurriyya</span> were good, but some clearly wronged themselves."</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Ṣāffāt 37:113</span>).</div></div><span id="bookmarks14"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p">Ribqah was not able to have children. Isḥāq (a.s.) prayed to Allāh many times asking for children. Finally his prayers were accepted and Ribqah became pregnant.<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>But amazingly, the babies inside the mother's abdomen were quarreling with each other. So Ribqah, wondering what trouble had come to her, went and asked Allāh (s.w.t.) about it.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>Allāh said, "You have two nations in your abdomen. Two separate nations will be born from you. One will become stronger than the other, and the oldest will serve the youngest."<span id="bookmarks23"></span></div><span id="bookmarks23"></span><a id="v24"></a>
<div class="p">Finally the time came, and Ribqah gave birth to two twin sons.<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>The oldest was reddish, and his whole body was hairy like dried sheep's skin. That is why they named him ʿIsāw.<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>The second son was born holding the heel of ʿIsāw. This is why they named him Yaʿqūb (a.s.).<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> When the twins were born, Hazrat Isḥāq was 60 years old.</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">So, as you see, the chain of blessing is continuing. Do you remember that Allāh (s.w.t.) had given this promise to Ibrāhīm (a.s.): "All the nations on the earth will find blessing through your <span class="wa">zurriyya</span>"? Then several sons were born from Ibrāhīm (a.s.) The first was Ismāʿīl (a.s.), the second was Isḥāq (a.s.), and then there were sons born from his wife Qiṭūrah.</span><span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span> \it But the chain of <span class="wa">baraka</span> continued through Isḥāq (a.s.), as Allāh had previously promised to Sārah. (This was even though Ismāʿīl (a.s.) was a firstborn.) And now two twin sons were born to Isḥāq (a.s.). The first was ʿIsāw, and the second was Yaʿqūb. Isḥāq (a.s.) thought that the <span class="wa">silsila</span> (chain/progression) of blessing would continue through the firstborn. But before they were born, Allāh had given a prophesy to Ribqah: "The eldest will serve the younger."</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks26"></span>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">ʿIsāw trades his rights as the firstborn</div></div><span id="bookmarks26"></span><a id="v27"></a>
<div class="p">The boys grew up. ʿIsāw became a skillful hunter and he loved to walk in the wilderness. But Yaʿqūb had a quiet nature, and did not like to wander too far from the camp.<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>Prophet Isḥāq enjoyed eating the animals ʿIsāw hunted, this is why he loved ʿIsāw more than Yaʿqūb. But Ribqah loved Yaʿqūb more.<span id="bookmarks28"></span></div><span id="bookmarks28"></span><a id="v29"></a>
<div class="p">One day ʿIsāw came back from hunting and was tired. Yaʿqūb was sitting and cooking lentil soup.<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>ʿIsāw said: "Give me some of that red<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span> soup to eat. I am very hungry."<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>Yaʿqūb said: "Okay, but first trade me your rights as the firstborn."<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>ʿIsāw said: "Oh! I am dying from hunger, why do I need my firstborn rights? You can have it, it is yours."<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>But Yaʿqūb insisted: "First swear to me." ʿIsāw swore and sold his firstborn rights to his younger brother.<span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a>This way, for one piece of bread and one cup of soup, he exchanged his firstborn rights. That is, he despised the inheritance coming from Ibrāhīm (a.s.) — the <span class="wa">silsila</span> of the Baraka. He ate and drank and then went away, as if nothing happened.<span id="bookmarks34"></span></div>
