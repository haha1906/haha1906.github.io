Allāh (s.w.t.) is holy and that is why His name is holy too. For this reason we should speak of Him only with respect. Do not use Allāh (s.w.t.)'s name for empty or false statements. Do not use it for your own benefit (for example, do not say \"Allāh (s.w.t.) my witness\" to prove something false you have said). An example might be saying \"Allāh (s.w.t.) said this\", when Allāh (s.w.t.) did not say that. If you even say \"Thank Allāh (s.w.t.)!\" without being thankful, you will commit a sin.</span></div>",
