<div class="p">\it This shows that Banī Isrāʾīl did not want to meet with Allāh (s.w.t.), in order to live with Him in <span class="wa">rābita</span>. For this reason Allāh (s.w.t.) gave them another ahd, the rules and regulations of the Sharīʿa Covenant.<span id="bookmarks1"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s1">Some examples taken from the laws of the Sharīʿa Covenant</div></div><span id="bookmarks1"></span><a id="v12"></a>
<div class="p">If someone hits someone else in order to kill him and he dies, you must punish him with death.<span id="bookmarks12,14"></span> <a id="v13"></a>But if it happened accidentally, do not punish him with death.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span><span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v15"></a>Give the death penalty to those who hit or insult their father or mother.<span id="bookmarks15,17"></span></div><span id="bookmarks15,17"></span><span id="bookmarks15,17"></span><a id="v16"></a>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">A man who kidnaps human being is worthy of the death penalty, no matter whether he sold him or not.<span id="bookmarks16"></span></div><span id="bookmarks16"></span><span id="bookmarks16"></span><a id="v18"></a>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">Suppose a quarrel occurs and someone injuries another person with a stone or with his fist. If that person stays in bed for a while<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>but later gets up, then do not punish the man who caused the injury. But he must pay for the injured man's lost wages and for the expenses of his treatment until he recovers.<span id="bookmarks19"></span></div><span id="bookmarks19"></span><span id="bookmarks19"></span><a id="v22"></a>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">Suppose two people are fighting, and in the process a pregnant woman gets hurt accidentally and gives birth prematurely. If she and her child are not hurt seriously, the man who hit her should pay a fine to her husband in the amount that he demands, with the judge's approval.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>But if she is seriously injured, then give him punishment that matches the injury: life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, leg for leg, burn for burn, bruise for bruise, and wound for wound.</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">To understand this law, let us imagine the following situation: Let's say your son hit the son of a rich man or an enemy and made him blind in one eye. What do you think-- what will his father do to your son? He may say, 'I will kill him.' Or he may say, 'I will blind him in both eyes.' The law given above limits the amount of punishment. The loss of one eye one is punished with the loss of one eye. If one tooth breaks, only one tooth is taken as punishment. (There will always be some people who want to break all the teeth.) But if one person forgives (and does not ask for punishment), that is better.</span><span id="bookmarks23-24"></span></div><span id="bookmarks23-24"></span><span id="bookmarks23-24"></span><a id="v28"></a>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">If someone's bull kills a man or a woman with its horns, kill the bull by throwing stones. You cannot eat its meat. Do not blame its owner.<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>But if people had warned him before and said that that his bull gores, and if he did not keep his bull under control, then stone the bull, and put the owner to death also.<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>He can save his life, by giving a payment, in the amount that they demand of him.<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>If the bull kills a small child, apply the same rule also.<span id="bookmarks31"></span></div><span id="bookmarks31"></span><span id="bookmarks31"></span><a id="v33"></a>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">Suppose someone digs a pit and does not cover it and then a cow or donkey falls into it and dies.<span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a>The man who got the pit dug must pay for the animal, but he will be able to keep the dead animal.<span id="bookmarks34"></span></div><span id="bookmarks34"></span><span id="bookmarks34"></span><a id="v35"></a>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">If someone's bull kills someone else's bull with its horns, sell the live bull and divide the money equally between the two owners. The dead animal also must be divided.<span id="bookmarks35"></span> <a id="v36"></a>But if he knew that his bull has a habit of attacking and did not keep it tied up, he must give the other person a live bull in place of the dead bull. However, he can keep the dead bull for himself.<span id="bookmarks36"></span></div><span id="bookmarks36"></span>
