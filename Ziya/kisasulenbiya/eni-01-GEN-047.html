<div class="s"><div id="s1">Settling in al-Sadīr</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Hazrat Yūsuf then came to Firʿawn and told him, "My father and my brothers came from Kanʿān with all their sheep and cows and with all of their wealth. Now they are in al-Sadīr."<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>Then he brought 5 of his brothers into the presence of Firʿawn.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>"What work do you do?" Firʿawn asked them. "We are shepherds like our ancestors", they answered.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>"Right now there is a severe famine in Kanʿān. There is no food for our animals. If you give permission, we will settle in the area of al-Sadīr."<span id="bookmarks4"></span></div><span id="bookmarks4"></span><a id="v5"></a>
<div class="p">Firʿawn said to Yūsuf (a.s.): "It's good that your father and brothers have arrived.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>Let your brothers settle in al-Sadīr. It is the best place of Miṣr. If there are skilled people among them, put them in charge of my flocks as well."<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>Then Hazrat Yūsuf brought in his father to Firʿawn. After Yaʿqūb (a.s.) asked Allah (s.w.t.) to bless Firʿawn,<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>Firʿawn asked him, "How old are you now?"<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>"I have lived only 130 years, traveling from place to place. My forefathers lived much longer than me. But their lives were not as difficult as mine," the prophet Yaʿqūb answered.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>Then before leaving he spoke another blessing on Firʿawn.<span id="bookmarks10"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Yūsuf (a.s.)'s service for Firʿawn</div></div><span id="bookmarks10"></span><a id="v13"></a>
<div class="p">The famine kept getting more severe. People were were suffering from hunger throughout the lands of Miṣr and Kanʿān.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>Hazrat Yūsuf sold grain to the Miṣriyyūn and Kanʿāniyyūn, and put all the money into Firʿawn's treasury.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>When the people ran out of money, the people came to Yūsuf (a.s.) and begged him, "Please give us grain, or we will die in front of your eyes! We have no money left."<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>Hazrat Yūsuf told them: "If your money is gone, bring me your animals. You will get grain in exchange for them."<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>Then they started bringing horses, donkeys, sheep and cows to Hazrat Yūsuf. One year passed like this.<span id="bookmarks17"></span></div><span id="bookmarks17"></span><a id="v18"></a>
<div class="p">The next year, the famine was was still severe. The people came again and said to Yūsuf (a.s.): "My lord, you see our situation: we have no money, and no animals left to sell.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>Let us not die in front of your eyes. Make us slaves to Firʿawn and take our lands. It is enough if you give us food in exchange. Then we'll stay alive, and the land will not be ruined."<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>Thus, Hazrat Yūsuf turned all the land in Miṣr into the property of Firʿawn.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>All the people of Miṣr became slaves of Firʿawn.<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>The only land that was not sold was the land belonging to the priests. That was because the priests received food from Firʿawn, so they did not need to sell their lands.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>Then Hazrat Yūsuf said to the people of Miṣr, "Now I have bought you (plural) and your lands for Firʿawn. From now on I will give you seed to plant.<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>Then each year, at the time of harvest, you will turn over one fifth of the harvest to Firʿawn, and you can keep the remaining four parts for food and for seed."<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>They answered, "You have showed goodness to us and saved our lives! We are ready to be Firʿawn's slaves," they said.<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>At that time, Hazrat Yūsuf established a law that says, "One fifth of the harvest produced in the country will be set aside as tax for Firʿawn." Only the lands of the priests were exempted from this.<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>Meanwhile, the Banī Isrāʾīl settled in the land of al-Sadīr. They quickly increased in number and in wealth.<span id="bookmarks27"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">Yaʿqūb (a.s.)'s dying Wish</div></div><span id="bookmarks27"></span><a id="v28"></a>
<div class="p">After coming to Miṣr, Hazrat Yaʿqūb lived 17 more years. (Altogether, he lived 147 years.)<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>As his death was approaching, he called his son Yūsuf to himself and said, "If you really love me, make a solemn promise to me that you will not bury me in Miṣr, but in Kanʿān,<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>in the place where our forefathers are buried." "I will do as you say, father," said Yūsuf (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>"No, swear!" said Hazrat Yaʿqūb. So Yūsuf (a.s.) gave his oath. Then Hazrat Yaʿqūb made <span class="wa">dhikr</span> saying <span class="wa">al-ḥamdulillah</span> with pure <span class="wa">niya </span> as he was leaning on his staff.<span id="bookmarks31"></span></div>
