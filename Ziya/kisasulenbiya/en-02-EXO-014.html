<a id="v1"></a>Firʿawn chases Banī Isrāʾīl
<div class="p"><span class="zv">5 </span> When Banī Isrāʾīl left Miṣr, Firʿawn and his officials were regretful and said, "Why have we let them go? Who will do our service now?"<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>At this time Banī Isrāʾīl had turned back to Baʿl Ṣifūn and built a camp on the seashore. <span class="zv">3 </span> When he heard this, Firʿawn thought: "They have gotten lost in the desert and can't get out!"<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v6"></a>So he took his army<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>and his war chariots<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span><span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>and began to pursue Banī Isrāʾīl. <span class="zv">4 </span> All of these were happening according to Allāh's will. Allāh had distanced His rahma away from Firʿawn, and this is why Firʿawn was resilient in his own decision.<span id="bookmarks8"></span></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v10"></a>
<div class="p">Firʿawn's army started getting closer.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> When the people of Isrāʾīl saw this, they were terrified, and started crying and praying to Allāh.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>Then they complained to prophet Mūsā saying: "Why did you bring us to the desert? Did you bring here to kill us? Were not there not enough graveyards in Miṣr? Why did you bring us out of Miṣr?<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>Did we not tell you to leave us alone, that we would rather continue serving the Miṣriyyūn?! It would be thousand times better to be slaves in Miṣr than to die in the desert."<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>"Do not be afraid!" said Mūsā (a.s.) "Be strong! You yourselves will witness how Allāh (s.w.t.) will save you. These Miṣriyyūn you see today will never be seen again.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>Allāh (s.w.t.) Himself will fight for you. You should only sit calmly and be patient."<span id="bookmarks14"></span></div><span id="bookmarks14"></span><a id="v15"></a>
<div class="p">Then a revelation came to Mūsā (a.s.) from Allāh (s.w.t.): "Stop wailing. Tell the people to get moving.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>Raise your staff and stretch it out over the sea and divide the water into two.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span> Then dry land will open and you (plural) will pass through in between." <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span><span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v19"></a>At that time the pillar of cloud moved to stand behind the nation of Isrāʾīl — between the Miṣriyyūn and ʿIbrāniyyūn. Until morning it gave light to one side and made the other side dark. As a result, the Firʿawn's army could not come any closer to Banī Isrāʾīl.<span id="bookmarks19-20"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s1">The Miṣriyyūn were defeated <span class="dc">"We parted the sea for you, so saving you and drowning Firʿawn’s people right before your eyes."</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Baqara 2:50</span>)</div></div><span id="bookmarks19-20"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p">As nabī Mūsā pointed his staff at the sea, Allāh (s.w.t.) sent a strong wind from the East. The wind divided the sea into two, and pushed the waters back all night long.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-4"><sup>e</sup></span> The sea divided and a dry land opened<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-5"><sup>f</sup></span> in between<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>and the people travelled to the other side of the sea. The water was standing vertical like walls on their left and right sides!<span id="bookmarks22"></span></div><span id="bookmarks22"></span><a id="v23"></a>
<div class="p">At daybreak the army of Firʿawn began to chase Banī Isrāʾīl.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-6"><sup>g</sup></span><span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>Then Allāh (s.w.t.) sent down panic from the pillar of fire into to the Miṣriy army.<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>He also broke the wheels of their chariots. When they saw this, the Miṣriyyūn cried out and said, "Retreat! Their God is fighting against us! Let's run away!"<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>Then Allāh (s.w.t.) said to Mūsā (a.s.): "Stretch your hand over the sea: let the waters fall over the Miṣriyyūn".<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>Mūsā (a.s.) stretched his hand towards the sea. It was sunrise.<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>The sea went back to its previous state. As the Miṣriyyūn were running away, the water swept them up and took them into the sea. All the armies of Firʿawn drowned, including all the chariots and horsemen who had followed Banī Isrāʾīl. Not one of them was left alive.<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>But the nation of Isrāʾīl walked through the sea without harm on the dry road that had opened up, with the water standing still like walls on both sides.</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="zv">4,17 </span> Yes, in this way Allāh (s.w.t.) defeated the Firʿawn's army and demonstrated His glory to all nations.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-7"><sup>h</sup></span></div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks29"></span><span id="bookmarks29"></span><a id="v30"></a>
<div class="p">So on that day Allāh freed the descendants of the prophet Yaʿqūb from the Miṣriyyūn. They saw the dead bodies of Miṣriyyūn laying on the seashore.<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>When they witnessed the power of Allāh (s.w.t.) with their own eyes, their hearts were filled the fear of Allāh (s.w.t.) — and they put faith in Allāh (s.w.t.) and in His servant Mūsā (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks31"></span></div>
