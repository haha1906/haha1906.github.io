<div class="s"><div id="s1">Yaʿqūb (a.s.) at his uncle's house</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Yaʿqūb (a.s.) continued his journey and arrived at the land east of Kanʿān.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>There he saw a well. And at the well, there were three flocks of sheep, and there was a big stone over the mouth of the well.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>(The stone was removed only when all people came with sheep, and after the sheep drank the water, they would cover the mouth of the well with the same stone again.)<span id="bookmarks3"></span></div><span id="bookmarks3"></span><a id="v4"></a>
<div class="p">"Brothers, where are you from?" Hazrat Yaʿqūb asked the shepherds. They answered, "From Ḥārān".<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Hazrat Yaʿqūb said, "Do you know someone called Labān? He is a grandson of Nāḥūr.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span>" "Yes, we know him," they answered.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>"Is he doing well?" Yaʿqūb asked. "Yes," said one of the shepherds, "Here, his daughter Rāḥīl is bringing their sheep."<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>Yaʿqūb said, "It is still a long time until the evening, so why don't you water your sheep and then take them to grаze?"<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>But they replied, "We can't move the stone from the mouth of the well until all the flocks are gathered together."<span id="bookmarks8"></span></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p">When they were still talking, Rāḥīl arrived at the well bringing her father's sheep. (Rāḥīl was the one taking care of her father's sheep.)<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>Then Hazrat Yaʿqūb quickly rolled the stone on the mouth of the well to one side, and watered his uncle's sheep.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>Then he greeted Rāḥīl, and he could not hold himself and wept<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>saying: "I am your aunt Ribqah's son." then Rāḥīl ran and informed her father.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>Hearing that his nephew had arrived, Lābān hurried to meet him, and hugged him and kissed his face. Then he took him to his house. When they were sitting at home, Yaʿqūb (a.s.) told his uncle everything that had happened.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>Labān said: "Do not worry. You really are my close relative. You will stay here, with me."<span id="bookmarks14"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Yaʿqūb (a.s.) gets married</div></div>
<div class="p">Hazrat Yaʿqūb lived there for about one month, <a id="v15"></a>and then his uncle asked him: "Will you keep serving for free just because you are a relative? Tell me how much you want me to pay for your service."<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>Labān had two daughters. The older daughter's name was Liʾā, and the younger daughter's name was Rāḥīl. Rāḥīl was the one who went to the well to water the sheep.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>(Rāḥīl was beautiful and had a nice figure, and Liʾā was a girl with pleasant face.)<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>But Yaʿqūb (a.s.) was in love with Rāḥīl. So he said: "If you let me marry your younger daughter Rāḥīl, I will serve you for seven years."<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>"Good," said Lābān, "It is better for me to give my daughter to you than to a stranger."<span id="bookmarks19"></span></div><span id="bookmarks19"></span><a id="v20"></a>
<div class="p">So, Hazrat Yaʿqūb served his uncle seven years for Rāḥīl. Because he loved Rāḥīl so much, the seven years seemed to him like seven days.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>When seven years were over, he said to Labān: "The appointed time limit has come. Now give us the permission for the wedding."<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>Labān gathered the people and prepared a feast.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>But that night, he brought his older daughter Liʾā to Yaʿqūb, not Rāḥīl.<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>(Labān had given his daughter Liʾā a maidservant named Zilfā as well, so that she could serve his daughter further.)<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>Yaʿqūb (a.s.) looked in the morning and there was Liʾā in the bed, and not Rāḥīl! "What have you done!?" he said to his uncle, burning in anger.<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>"I served you seven years for Rāḥīl! Why did you deceive me?!" Labān answered: "It is a custom here that we do not give a younger daughter in marriage when the older is not married.<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>If you want, have patience for one more week,<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> I will give you Rāḥīl also. But you will serve me another seven years."<span id="bookmarks27"></span></div><span id="bookmarks27"></span><a id="v28"></a>
<div class="p">Yaʿqūb (a.s.) agreed. When the feast was over (after one week), Labān gave his younger daughter Rāḥīl also to Hazrat Yaʿqūb in marriage.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span><span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>(And he gave Rāḥīl a maidservant Bilhā in addition.)<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>But Yaʿqūb loved Rāḥīl more than Liʾā. And afterwards he served Labān for seven more years for Rāḥīl.</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">It sounds strange that Yaʿqūb (a.s.) served 14 years to marry Rāḥīl, doesn't it? You know, we are ready to pay a very big price for the things we really want, things we consider very dear. It looks like for prophet Yaʿqūb it was very important to marry a good girl. He wanted to spend all of his life together with Rāḥīl. </span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Now let us think about ourselves. What do you think is the most important thing in life? For which purpose would you spend your life or your money on? What are you spending your time on now? Is the thing you are spending your money or your time on, worthy of this?</span><span id="bookmarks30"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">The rivalry between Rāḥīl and Liʾā</div></div><span id="bookmarks30"></span><a id="v31"></a>
<div class="p">Seeing that Liʾā was not loved by her husband, Allāh (s.w.t.) gave her several children. But Rāḥīl could not have children.<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>Liʾā named her first son Raʾūbin,<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span> saying: "Allāh (s.w.t.) saw my distress and gave me a child. Now my husband will love me."<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>When she bore her second son, she named him Samīʿun,<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-4"><sup>e</sup></span> saying "Allāh (s.w.t.) heard that my husband does not love me, and He gave me another son."<span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a>The third time she became pregnant and had a son again, and said: "I bore three sons to my husband. Now he will be bound to me", and named him Lāwī <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-5"><sup>f</sup></span><span id="bookmarks34"></span> <a id="v35"></a>The fourth time she bore a boy again. And named him Yahūdā<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-6"><sup>g</sup></span> saying, "Praises to Allāh!". Then she stopped bearing children.<span id="bookmarks35"></span></div>
