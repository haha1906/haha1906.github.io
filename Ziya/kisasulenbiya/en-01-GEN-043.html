<div class="s"><div id="s1">What Next? Our Grain has Finished <span class="dc">"Am I to entrust him to you as I did his brother before? ...I will never send him with you, not unless you swear by Allāh that you will bring him back to me if that is humanly possible."</span> (<span class="xdc">Yūnus12:64,66</span>)</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">The famine was very harsh in Kanʿān.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>After eating up the grain they had brought from Miṣr, Yaʿqūb (a.s) said to his sons, "Now you need to go back and bring us some more grain."<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>"Father," said Yahūdā, "the governor of Miṣr told us sternly: 'You will not be able to see me unless you bring your brother.'<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>If you send Binyāmin with us, we'll go and bring back grain.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>If you don't send him, we won't go. He told us not to show up if without our brother."<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>"Why did you tell him that you had another brother?!" Hazrat Yaʿqūb said to his sons. "You have brought disaster to me!"<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>They answered, "That man questioned us persistently. He showered questions on us saying: 'Is your father alive? Do you have other brothers?' We could not do anything but answer. How could we have known that he would say 'bring your brother here'?"<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>Yahūdā said to his father: "Give me Binyāmin. Let us start the journey. Otherwise none of us will stay alive. All of us, you also, and the children also, will die from hunger.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>I personally guarantee that we will bring Binyāmin back safe and sound. If I do not bring him back safe and sound, I will bear the blame forever.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>If you had not delayed, we could have gone to Miṣr twice already."<span id="bookmarks10"></span></div><span id="bookmarks10"></span><a id="v11"></a>
<div class="p">Finally Yaʿqūb (a.s.) consented to the words of his sons and said, "Alright, if there is no other way, what can I do? But do not go empty-handed. Take the best products of Kanʿān — some balm, a little honey, perfumes, myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds — and give them as gifts to the governor of Miṣr.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>Also, return the money which you found inside the sacks. Probably some kind of mistake happened last time.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>Take your brother, then, and get on with the journey.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>Allāh is able to do everything. May He put some love toward you into the heart of that man. May that man permit Binyāmin and his brother to return. But if I have to lose my children, then what can I do?"<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">The Prophet Yaʿqūb had no other choice than to rely on the Creator. That poor father had put all his hope in Allāh: "May Allāh (s.w.t.) create love toward you into the heart of that man!" In the Qurʾān, there is an āya spoken by nabī Yaʿqūb: <span class="dc">"All power is in Allāh's hands. I put my \wa tawakkul\wa* in Him only. Those who want to do \wa tawakkul\wa*, should put \wa tawakkul\wa* in Him only."</span> \it (<span class="xdc">Yūsuf 12:67</span>)</span><span id="bookmarks14"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">In Miṣr Again</div></div><span id="bookmarks14"></span><a id="v15"></a>
<div class="p">So, they took those gifts, along with twice as much money as the previous time, and went to Miṣr. Binyāmin was also with them. They arrived in Miṣr and went directly to Hazrat Yūsuf.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>As soon as Yūsuf (a.s.) saw Binyāmin, he said to his palace manager: "Take those people home. Slaughter a fattened animal and prepare food. They will eat lunch with me."<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>The palace manager said: "Yes, sir," and took them to Hazrat Yūsuf's palace.<span id="bookmarks17"></span></div><span id="bookmarks17"></span><a id="v18"></a>
<div class="p">When they learned where they were going, they became very afraid. They thought, "They are taking us here because of the money we found in our sacks. Now they will take everything we have and will make us slaves."<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>When they arrived at the gate of the palace, they approached Hazrat Yūsuf's palace manager and said:<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>"Sir, we bought grain from you before.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>And when we returned home and opened the sacks, the money we had paid for the grain was inside the sacks!<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>For that reason, we brought that money back also. But we do not know who put that money into our sacks. We have brought more money for the grain we are going to buy this time."<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>"Do not worry," the palace manager said. "Probably the god of your ancestors put that money into your sacks. I received the money you paid." Then he brought Samīʿun to them<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>and brought all of them into the house of Hazrat Yūsuf. he brought water for them to wash their feet, and gave them food for their donkeys.<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>Then the eleven brothers heard that they were going to eat with the governor. So they prepared the gifts they had brought<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>and when Hazrat Yūsuf entered the house, they bowed down to the ground before him and presented their gifts.<span id="bookmarks26"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">The Feast</div></div><span id="bookmarks26"></span><a id="v27"></a>
<div class="p">After greeting them, Hazrat Yūsuf asked: "Is your father alright? Is he healthy?"<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>"Praise Allāh he is well, safe and sound", they said and bowed down again to Yūsuf (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>Then Yūsuf (a.s.) looked at Binyāmin. "Is this the youngest brother you told me about?" he asked. Then he said, "May Allāh bless you, my son!"<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>Suddenly his love swelled up in him and he could not hold himself, so he went out of the room in haste. He went into his sleeping room and wept, emptying his heart there.<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>After he washed his face, he took control of himself and went to where his brothers were. Then he ordered his servants to bring food.<span id="bookmarks31"></span></div><span id="bookmarks31"></span><a id="v32"></a>
<div class="p">One table was set for his brothers, and one for Hazrat Yūsuf. (The Miṣriyyūn sat in a different place, because they thought it was disgusting for them to eat together with the ʿIbrāniyyūn.)<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>They seated the guests around the table according to their age. The brothers were surprized at this.<span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a>The food was served to them from Yūsuf's (a.s.) table. Binyāmin got 5 times more food than the others.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> All of them ate and drank as much as they wanted.<span id="bookmarks34"></span></div>
