<div class="p">Don't participate in wrongdoing, even when the majority is involved in it. Don't trample justice by following the crowd during a lawsuit.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>At a trial, don't even take the side of a poor person just because he is poor.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v6"></a>And don't trample someone's rights just because he is poor.<span id="bookmarks6"></span></div><span id="bookmarks6"></span><a id="v4"></a>

<div class="p">Don't participate in false accusations, and do not let yourself be involved in condemning innocent people to death. I will not leave such people without punishment.<span id="bookmarks7"></span></div><span id="bookmarks7"></span><a id="v8"></a>

<div class="p">Don't ill-treat foreigners. You know very well what it is like to be a foreigner. You yourselves were once foreigners in Miṣr. <span class="zv">Lev 24:22 </span> In the court, apply laws in the same way to both yourselves and to foreigners.</div>

This way, you will get rid of the evil.<span id="bookmarks9"></span></div><span id="bookmarks9"></span><span id="bookmarks9"></span><a id="v10"></a>

Do not work on the land during the year of rest, but let poor people use whatever grows on its own. Wild animals can have what is left. Do the same with your vineyards and olive gardens.<span id="bookmarks11"></span></div><span id="bookmarks11"></span><a id="v12"></a>

On the contrary, completely destroy their idols, and break down the stones they set up. Because you belong to Me!<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>If you serve Me, I will add blessings to your food and water, and I will keep you from all kinds of diseases.<span id="bookmarks25"></span><span id="bookmarks25"></span></div>
