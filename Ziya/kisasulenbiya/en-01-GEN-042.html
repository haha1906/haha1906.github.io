<div class="s"><div id="s1">The Meeting with his Brothers</div></div>
<div class="p"><span class="zv">5 </span> The famine was affecting Kanʿān also. <a id="v1"></a>Hazrat Yaʿqūb heard that there was grain in Miṣr,<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>so he called his sons and said, "Why are you sitting here looking at each other? I have heard there is grain in Miṣr. Go and buy grain, otherwise all of us will die from hunger."<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>So he sent his ten sons to Miṣr.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>But he did not send Binyāmin with them, being afraid that something may happen to him.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>So the sons of Hazrat Yaʿqūb came to Miṣr to buy grain.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>Yūsuf (a.s.) had the right to decide who should get how much grain, which is why his brothers came and bowed down to the ground before him.<span id="bookmarks6"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">The Brothers Bow Down <span class="dc">"Yūsuf's brothers came and presented themselves before him. He recognized them but they did not recognize him."</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span></div></div><span id="bookmarks6"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p">Though Yūsuf recognized his brothers immediately, he behaved as if he did not. He called his translator to himself and said harshly: "Ask them where they came from!" "Sir, we came from Kanʿān," they answered. "We've come to buy grain."<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>The brothers said this because they did not recognize Yūsuf (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks8"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">A Test</div></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p">Hazrat Yūsuf remembered his dreams which he had seen many years ago about his brothers, and said: "No, you are spies. You came here to spy."<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>"No, my lord!" they exclaimed. "We your slaves came here with only one reason: to buy grain.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>We all are the sons of one father. We are honest people, we are not spies."<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>"No, it is a lie," said Hazrat Yūsuf, "You came here to spy."<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>"My lord," they said, "we your slaves were twelve brothers. We are from Kanʿān. Our youngest brother is back there with our father, and one of our brothers is no longer with us," they answered.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>"No, you are spies!" said Yūsuf (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>"I will test you:<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>one of you must go and bring that youngest brother of yours. I will keep the rest here in prison. I swear by the name of Firʿawn, if you do not bring him and show him to me, you cannot leave. I will see whether your words are true or false. If you are lying, then you are spies."<span id="bookmarks16"></span></div><span id="bookmarks16"></span><a id="v17"></a>
<div class="p">So Yūsuf (a.s.) kept them in prison for three days.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>On the third day he said this to them: "I am an Allāh-fearing man. If you do what I say, you will stay alive.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>If you are honest men, then one of you must stay here in the prison. The others will go and take grain to your hungry families.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>After that, bring your youngest brother to me. That will prove that your words were true, and you will be free from the punishment of death." They accepted this condition.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>Then they said to each other: "All this has happened to us because of the evil we did to Yūsuf. He begged and pleaded with us, but we did not have mercy on him. That is why Allāh has made this thing happen to us!"<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>Raʾūbin said: "I told you not to touch Yūsuf, but you did not listen. Now Allāh is asking us to pay the price for his death."<span id="bookmarks22"></span></div><span id="bookmarks22"></span><a id="v23"></a>
<div class="p">Hazrat Yūsuf understood everything they said. But his brothers did not know that, because Yūsuf (a.s.) was only speaking with them through an interpreter.<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>After Raʾūbin spoke, Hazrat Yūsuf could not hold himself and went outside. He went to a private place and wept. After that, he came back and talked with his brothers for a while. Then he had Samīʿun bound before their eyes.<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>He told his servants to fill their sacks with grain and give them food for the journey. (According to a secret order given by Hazrat Yūsuf, the money they paid for the grain was put back into each man's sack.)<span id="bookmarks25"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s4">On the road</div></div><span id="bookmarks25"></span><a id="v26"></a>
<div class="p">So, nine brothers loaded their sacks on donkeys and started on the journey to Kanʿān.<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>That night they stopped in one place to spend the night. One of them opened his sack to give food to his donkey. And he saw that there was the money he had given — right at the top of the sack!<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>Immediately he called his brothers and said: "Look! My money has been returned; it's here in my sack!" When they saw the money, all of the brothers became afraid. Trembling, they said to each other, "What has Allāh done to us?" They were all afraid.<span id="bookmarks28"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s5">In Kanʿān</div></div><span id="bookmarks28"></span><a id="v29"></a>
<div class="p">When they arrived home, they told Hazrat Yaʿqūb what happened. They said,<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>"The governor of Miṣr was not hospitable to us. He thought we were spies.<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>We told him that we are honest people, not spies.<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>We said that we are twelve brothers from one father; one brother is no more, and our youngest brother is at home with our father in Kanʿān.<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>Then the governor said, 'If you are speaking the truth, one of you will stay here, and the others will go and take grain to your hungry families.<span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a>Then you will bring your youngest brother to me. And then I will believe that you are not spies, but honest people. If your words are true, then I will return your brother to you safe and sound. Then you can come and go to Miṣr with no problem.' After he said that, he kept Samīʿun."<span id="bookmarks34"></span></div><span id="bookmarks34"></span><a id="v35"></a>
<div class="p">As they started emptying their sacks, they saw that the money that each man had paid was inside his sack! Hazrat Yaʿqūb and his sons were terrified when they saw this.<span id="bookmarks35"></span> <a id="v36"></a>"What?!" said Yaʿqūb (a.s.) trembling. "Are you going to deprive me of all of my children?! Everything is going against me! You took away Yūsuf and Samīʿun. Now are you going to take Binyāmin as well?"<span id="bookmarks36"></span> <a id="v37"></a>"Father," said Raʾūbin, "Trust Binyāmin to me. If I do not bring him safe and sound, here, you can kill my two sons."<span id="bookmarks37"></span> <a id="v38"></a>"No!" said Hazrat Yaʿqūb. "My son will not go with you. He was separated from his brother and now he is left alone! If something happens to him as well, you (Plural) will send me to the grave alive!"<span id="bookmarks38"></span></div>
