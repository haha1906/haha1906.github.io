<div class="m">But you stand up, and take your nation that you brought out of Miṣr, and go to the land which I promised to your ancestors Ibrāhīm, Isḥāq and Yaʿqūb, tooking an oath saying "I will give it to your descendants".<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>An angel will go in front of you, he will drive out the Kanʿāniyyūn, Amūribbūn, Ḥittiyyūn, Farizziyyūn, Ḥawiyyūn and Yabūsiyyūn.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>Go to the land of milk and honey, but I will not go with you (plural), so that I will not destroy you (plural) on the road, because you're (plural) a stubborn nation.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>Say to the nation of Isrāʾīl: "You are a stubborn nation. If I will be with you for a moment, I will destroy you. Now put off your ornaments, so I will decide what to do to you".</div>
<div class="p">The nation hearing this wept wailing. No one put on ornaments.<span id="bookmarks4-5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>Thus, the Banī Isrāʾīl put off their decorations on the mountain of Saynāʾ and didn't put them on again.<span id="bookmarks6"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s1">The Tent of Meeting</div></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">One of the commands given to nabī Mūsā was about a special tent.</span> <a id="v7"></a>Mūsā (a.s) placed it outside of the camp and named it the "Tent of Meeting." After that those who wanted to ask something from Allāh (s.w.t.) went to the Tent of Meeting.<span id="bookmarks7"></span></div><span id="bookmarks7"></span><a id="v8"></a>
<div class="p">Every time when Hazrat Mūsā went towards the Tent, the people would come out of their tents, and look behind him until he entered the Tent.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>After rasulullah entered the Tent, the pillar of cloud would come down from above, and stand at the door of the Tent, and this meant that Allāh (s.w.t.) was speaking with Mūsā (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>When the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the door of the Tent, they would get up and bow down to Allāh near their tents.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>Allāh (s.w.t.) used to speak with Mūsā (a.s.) directly, just like people talk to their friends. After the conversation, Hazrat Mūsā would come back to the camp, but his helper Yūshaʿ b. Nūn would not leave the Tent.<span id="bookmarks11"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Musa's (a.s.) begging "be with us"</div></div><span id="bookmarks11"></span><a id="v12"></a>
<div class="p">Then the rasul made duʿa to Allāh (s.w.t.) and said: "Oh Provider, You told me to be the head of the nation, but whom will you send with me? <span class="it">Who is that angel that You said about?</span> You did tell me: I chose you, took close to Me, you found mercy in My sight!<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>If I found mercy, I beg you open Your will to me, so that I will know you better, I will please you. After all, Banī Isrāʾīl is Your nation!"<span id="bookmarks13"></span></div><span id="bookmarks13"></span><a id="v14"></a>
<div class="p">Then Allāh (s.w.t.) said to him: "I will be with you (singular). I will give peace to your soul".<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>"No, -- said Hazrat Mūsā (a.s.). -- If You won't be with Banī Isrāʾīl, don't send us from here.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>After all, how would it be known that You are pleased by me and Your nation? Isn't it through Your being with us? Isn't this the difference of us from other nations on earth?"<span id="bookmarks16"></span></div><span id="bookmarks16"></span><a id="v17"></a>
<div class="p">Then Allāh (s.w.t.) said: "My angel will go with you (Plural). Because I am pleased with you (singular), you (singular) are very close to Me".<span id="bookmarks17"></span></div>

<div class="p">Then Mūsā (a.s.) begged Allāh (s.w.t.) saying: "Oh my Rabb, please, let me see You once, show me Your glory."<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>Allāh said: "I will show you My raḥma and I will reveal My Raḥmān name. Because I will show mercy whom I want to show mercy and I will give raḥma to whom I want to give raḥma, -- He said. --<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>But you (singular) can not see My face, because a man who sees Me does not stay alive."<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>Then He said: "Here is a rock here. You will get onto this rock.<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>When I do tajallī, I will put you in the cave which is in the rock, and I will keep covering you with My hand.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>After My glory passed on I will take my hand off, you will see Me as if from behind the veil." <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span><span id="bookmarks23"></span></div>
