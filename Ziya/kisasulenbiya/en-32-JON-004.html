<div class="p">But Yūnus was shocked<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> that the Nināwiyyūn were granted compassion.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> So he became very angry.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span> Then he made <span class="wa">du‘wa</span> and complained to Allāh: 'Ya Rabb, isn’t this what I said would happen when I was still in my own country? This is why I fled out to sea the first time: I know that you are compassionate and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness, and that you have compassion upon those threatened with calamity.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span> Ya Allāh! Take my soul from me because I am in anguish. I would be better off dead than alive.'</div>
<div class="p">Then Allāh replied: “Are you really that angry?”<span id="bookmarks1-4"></span></div><span id="bookmarks1-4"></span><a id="v5"></a>
<div class="p">Then Yūnus left Nināwā and sat down in a place east of the city. He wanted to wait there and see what would happen to the city, so he made a shelter and sat in its shade. Nabī Yūnus was suffering in the sun because the shade wasn’t enough, so Allāh appointed a spreading tree <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-4"><sup>e</sup></span> with large leaves to grow over the shelter and give him cool shade for his head. This eased his suffering and the Prophet rejoiced greatly about the vine.<span id="bookmarks5-6"></span></div><span id="bookmarks5-6"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p">But the next day, at Fajr, Allāh appointed a worm to chew the leafy tree so that its leaves withered. He also sent a very hot wind from the East and the sun beat down on Yūnus' head. He became so weak that he asked Allāh to take his soul again. He said to Allāh taʿāla: 'Rabbī, I would be better off dead than alive.' Allāh answered Yūnus : “Are you really that angry about the leafy tree?”<span id="bookmarks7-8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>Yunus answered, “I really am that angry! I am angry enough to die!”<span id="bookmarks9"></span></div><span id="bookmarks9"></span><a id="v10"></a>
<div class="p">Allāh said to Nabī Yūnus : 'Pay attention! You are concerned to save this leafy tree from the worm, even though you didn’t do anything to tend it or make it grow. It sprang up overnight, and it died overnight! Shouldn’t I be concerned to save an important city like this from disaster—even if they sinned? Isn’t Nināwā an important city with more than 100,000 people<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-5"><sup>f</sup></span> who lack <span class="wa">hidāya</span>?<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-6"><sup>g</sup></span> Aren’t even their cattle of more worth than a short-lived tree?'<span id="bookmarks10-11"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">Explanation</div></div>
<div class="p">The Quran Karim reminds us of several important lessons from this story. Allāh tells us that we should learn from the example of Yūnus: 'Wait patiently for the Lord’s Judgement: do not be like the companion of the fish.' Yūnus knew that Allāh wanted him to go to Nināwā, but he tried to run away from what Allāh had commanded him to do. He withdrew from worshipping Allāh and from other believers. What about you? Are you trying to avoid something you know that Allāh wants you to do?</div>
<div class="p">It is also important that we learn to have patience and avoid living in anger. If we allow ourselves to remain angry at our enemies we can easily begin to have a bad opinion about Allāh (s.w.t.). We must be patient because Allāh may intend to show mercy to our enemies. Allāh (s.w.t.) will punish evildoers. Eventually He did punish the Nināwiyyūn and destroy their city. Today its ruins are located near the city of Mosul in Iraq. The Quran Karim mentions this when it says that after they repented, Allāh <span class="dc">'let them enjoy life for a time'</span> <span class="xdc">Yūnus 10:98</span>. Though the city repented, later inhabitants forgot the message and promises of Allāh. We should not doubt that what Allāh has ordained is good and just. Living in anger shows that we have these doubts.</div>
<div class="p">Yūnus (a.s.) did not want to accept Allāh (s.w.t.)'s qadr for these people. He ran from Allāh (s.w.t.)'s command because he thought the Nināwiyyūn should be destroyed. Only when he was drowning did he admit some of his mistakes and praise Allāh as He deserves. Allāh rescued him or he would have remained in the belly of the grave. When Allāh's command came to him a second time, he acted on his repentance and obeyed Allāh. Yet he remained angry when Allāh showed mercy to the Nināwiyyūn. Do you notice the contradictions in the life of Yūnus?</div>
<div class="p">It is difficult for us to know for sure why Yūnus was so angry. We do know that Allāh sent the worm to eat the leafy tree He had provided to teach him a lesson about purifying his heart (<span class="wa">tazkīya</span>). Perhaps Yūnus thought that tree was more important than the people of Nināwā. Can we say that those who wish disaster to fall on sinners have not understood the lesson Allāh has for us in the story of Yūnus? Is Allāh still concerned for people today, even sinners and *<span class="wa">mushrik</span>? Are we patient with our enemies in hope that they will repent, or at least patient for Allāh's <span class="wa">qadr</span> concerning them?</div>
<div class="p">This story of Nabī Yūnus gives hope to those who have a low state. Even when people are stubborn in their sins and careless about <span class="wa">yawm al-qiyāma</span>, Allāh remains merciful, al-Rahman. He did not abandon Yūnus in the belly of the grave, nor will He abandon any of us if we repent and turn to Him. <span class="dc">*Inna Allāha yuhibbu ut-tawwābīn.* 'Allah loves those who repent.' </span> <span class="xdc">Al-Baqara 2: 222</span>. If you look around, you may even notice that he is patiently encouraging you to renew your <span class="wa">īmān</span> and repent of your sins. Allāh is not like us. He will not withhold his forgiveness from those He knows will repent. We can even say that He wants to forgive sinners, if they will turn to Him. He will open the hearts of those who surrender to Him. Allāh loves those who respond to His Prophets with faith and repentance.</div>
