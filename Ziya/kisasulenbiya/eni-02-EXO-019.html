<div class="p">When it was exactly 2 months after they left Miṣr,<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>they arrived at the desert of Saynāʾ, to the mountain that was in the valley of Tuva. They built a camp there at the foot of the mountain.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>Mūsā (a.s.) went up to the mountain in order to get guidance from Allāh. Then a voice came to him saying:<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>"Here, I have brought you out of the Miṣr safe and sound, from the land of slavery. From now on you belong to Me.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>If you listen to My words, and stay faithful to My covenant made with Ibrāhīm, you will be My priceless treasure among all nations. Yes, the whole earth is Mine.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>But you (plural) will be My holy kingdom, and you will share ʿilm and hidāya to all (other) nations.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> Go and deliver My words to the people." <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span><span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>Mūsā (a.s.) came down from the mountain and called the elders and declared to them about the <span class="wa">daʿwa</span> of Allāh.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>Everybody agreed together and promised, "We will do everything Allāh (s.w.t.) has said." \it In this way, Banī Isrāʾīl promised to put their faith in the friendship covenant Allāh (s.w.t.) had made with Hazrat Ibrāhīm (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks8"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Allāh shows miracle to the nation</div></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v10"></a>
<div class="p">Then Allāh (s.w.t.) said to Mūsā (a.s.): "Tell the people that they should purify themselves today and tomorow and wash their clothes.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>They should be ready on the third day. On the third day I will demonstrate My miracles on Mount Saynāʾ in the sight of all the people.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>Mark a boundary around the mountain. Then instruct everybody: nobody should come close to the mountain.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>If anyone sets his foot on the mountain, kill him with stones or arrows. No human hand should touch him. Whether it is an animal or human being, do not let it live. The people should only go up the mountain after a long blast from the ram's horn."<span id="bookmarks13"></span></div><span id="bookmarks13"></span><a id="v14"></a>
<div class="p">The messenger of Allāh came down from the mountain and said to the people: "Wash your clothes, and be purified. Don't have relations with your wife. Get prepared for the third day!"<span id="bookmarks14-15"></span></div><span id="bookmarks14-15"></span><a id="v16"></a>
<div class="p">On the morning of the third day, there was thunder and lightning on the mountain. A thick cloud covered the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast was heard everywhere. All the people in the camp were trembling from fear.<span id="bookmarks16"></span></div><span id="bookmarks16"></span><a id="v17"></a>
<div class="p">Mūsā (a.s.) brought the people out of the camp and took them to the foot of the mountain in order to make them meet Allāh.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>Then the mountain shook violently. Allāh (s.w.t.) had brought down fire on the mountain, and thick smoke was climbing up to the sky.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>The voice of the trumpet was growing louder and louder.<span id="bookmarks19"></span></div>
