<div class="ip">\it As it is written in many books, Ibrāhīm's (a.s.) people were worshipping lifeless idols, and would not acknowledge living Allāh. But Ibrāhīm (a.s.) was looking for answers for questions like: "Is there a Rabb over the world? Who is the rabb of all worlds?"<span id="bookmarks2"></span></div>

This is greater.’ But when the sun set, \it (he started thinking that there must be a greater Being who must have created all these. Then he said: ‘My people, I disown all that you worship beside God. I have turned my face as a true believer towards Him who created the heavens and the earth. I am not one of the <span class="wa">mushriks</span>.’"</span> \it (<span class="xdc">Al-Anʿām, 6:76-79</span>).</div>

<div class="p">\it In one of those days Allāh (s.w.t.) gave him <span class="wa">wahiy</span> and said: <span class="dc">"Aslim"</span>. \it The meaning is, "Submit to Me". Ibrāhīm immediately said, <span class="dc">"Aslamtu li-rabbi l-ʿālamīn",</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span>\it which means, "I've submitted, I believe in the Lord of the worlds".

<div class="p"><span class="dc">(Ibrāhīm) asked his father and his people, ‘What do you worship?’ They said, ‘We worship idols, and are constantly in attendance on them.’ He asked, ‘Do they hear you when you call?

<div class="p">\it After a while the people returned from the festival and saw the idols broken and got angry, and asked Ibrāhīm (a.s.): <span class="dc">"Was it you, Ibrāhīm, who did this to our gods?"</span> \it He answered making fun of them, <span class="dc">"No, it was done by the biggest of them– this one.

<div class="p">\it After that the king of those people<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-6"><sup>e</sup></span> called Ibrāhīm to his presence and said, "Who is your god? Have you ever seen him?" Ibrāhīm (a.s.) said, "My Lord is the one who resurrects and causes death". The king said, "I'm also able to do that. If two people are judged to be killed, I will kill one of them and the other one I forgive." Then Ibrāhīm (a.s.) said, <span class="dc">"Allāh brings the sun from the east. (If you're powerful,) you bring it from the west!"</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-7"><sup>*</sup></span> \it The king couldn't answer and was silenced.</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks9"></span><span id="bookmarks9"></span><a id="v10"></a>

<div class="s"><div id="s6">The Wisdom of the Story</div></div><span id="bookmarks11"></span><a id="v12"></a>
<div class="p">\it Ibrāhīm (a.s.) put his <span class="wa">tawakkul</span> in Allāh even though they said that they would burn him in the fire. Allāh brought Ibrāhīm (a.s.) from the <span class="wa">maqām</span> of <span class="wa">īmān</span> to the <span class="wa">maqām\wa of \wa tawakkul</span> (or trust). In this kind of situation, every believer hopes that Allāh will rescue him. Because if Allāh wills, He will save us even from disasters like fire and water. And even if He doesn't save us, our trust in Allāh's compassion toward us should remain firm.</div>

<div class="p">\it When Ibrāhīm (a.s.) was thrown into fire, Allāh (s.w.t.) saved him. In Qurʾān al-Karīm there is a command, <span class="dc">"Fire, be cool and safe for Ibrāhīm!"</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-9"><sup>*</sup></span> \it And even though the prophet Ibrāhīm's tribe planned to harm him, Allāh made them suffer the greatest loss.</div>
