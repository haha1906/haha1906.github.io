<div class="s"><div id="s1">The golden calf <span class="dc">"Remember that We gave each other promises with Mūsā for forty nights, and after he left, you did evil to yourselves by doing ibādāt to a calf!"</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Baqara 2:51</span>).</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Nabī Mūsā was late and did not come down from the mountain, so the people put Hārūn (a.s.) in the middle and said: "It seems something happened to Mūsā on the mountain. Get up. Make for us an ilāh. Otherwise who will guide us in the desert?"</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks1"></span><span id="bookmarks1"></span><a id="v2"></a>
<div class="p">\it Just imagine, Banī Isrāʾīl has been waiting almost for 40 days for nabī Mūsā. It has been almost 40 days, but still he -- the leader appointed by Allāh was missing. What must be done? Who will lead the people from now on? Whom can we put our hope for?<span id="bookmarks2"></span></div><span id="bookmarks2"></span><a id="v3"></a>
<div class="p">\it Finally Banī Isrāʾīl's patience was full. If Mūsā is no more, who will connect them to Allāh now? Who will be ilāh for them? So the people decided to create a god for themselves. In front of the eyes of Allāh this was a very heavy sin. <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span><span id="bookmarks3"></span></div><span id="bookmarks3"></span><a id="v4"></a>
<div class="p">\it As it is written in Qurʾān al-Karīm: <span class="dc">"He brought them out a form of a calf which made a lowing sound (moo). The people said: 'Here is your ilāh, and ilāh of Mūsā, he just had forgotten (to tell you).'"</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> Yes, now the people were shouting loudly: "You Banī Isrāʾīl! Here is our ilāhayn who brought us out of Miṣr!".</div>
<div class="p">\it To speak otherwisely, the fitna has started among the people. Then Hārūn (a.s.) wanted to turn the people from sin and called them: <span class="dc">"Oh my people, by doing this you are being faced to fitna. No doubt that your lord is Raḥmān. So follow me. Obey my order."</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span><span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Then he built an altar in front of the golden calf and announced saying: "Tomorrow we will hold a festival devoted to Allāh." \it But the people were out of the Path already. <span class="dc">"Banī Isrāʾīl said: 'Until Mūsā is back, we'll continue worshipping (the calf).'"</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span><span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>And in the next day they got up early, and started bringing sacrifices. Eating-drinking, the enjoyment grew up.<span id="bookmarks6"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">"Your people are in fasod"</div></div><span id="bookmarks6"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p">Allāh (s.w.t.) saw what they were doing and said to prophet Mūsā: "Your people are immersed into dirtiness.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>They quickly turned their face from My commands, and made a calf to themselves to worship. Here, everybody is crying loudly slaughtering sacrifices to the calf: "Oh Banī Isrāʾīl! Here, this god brought you out of Miṣr".<span id="bookmarks8"></span></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p">Allāh was very angry of what they did!</div>
<div class="p">"This nation is stubborn! How stubborn are they!<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>I will destroy them completely! I will make them zero from the face of the earth! Then I will create a great nation from yourself."<span id="bookmarks10"></span></div><span id="bookmarks10"></span><a id="v11"></a>
<div class="p">But Prophet Mūsā started begging: "My Lord! Have mercy on Your people! You brought them out of Miṣr with Your power.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>So do not let the Miṣriyyūn say: "Here, God took them with evil intention! To kill them on the mountain!"<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>Remember your servants Ibrāhīm, Isḥāq and Yaʿqūb. You swore to them saying: "I will increase your descendants like stars in the sky, and I will give the promised land to your descendants as an eternal inheritance".<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>After that Allāh (s.w.t.) accepted the prayer of Mūsā (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks14"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">The breaking of the stone tablets</div></div><span id="bookmarks14"></span><a id="v15"></a>
<div class="p">As prophet Mūsā was coming down from the mountain, he had in his hands the stone tablets with the writings written on both sides.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>(These tablets were made by Allāh Himself, and the engraved ayats on them also were the handwriting of Allāh (s.w.t.).)<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-4"><sup>e</sup></span><span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v19"></a>At this time the enjoyment was in full flow at the camp and people were dancing around the golden calf. Seeing this Mūsā (a.s.) got very angry, and threw the tablets which were in his hands. (The tablets with divine āyāt written on them hit the stones and broke into pieces.)<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>Then he came and burned on the fire the calf they had made, crushed it into tiny pieces and poured its ashes into the spring from which the people used to drink.<span id="bookmarks20"></span></div><span id="bookmarks20"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p">Then he asked his brother Hārūn: "Why did you immerse the people/nation into such a heavy sin? What have they done to you?"<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>"My lord, do not be angry, — said Hārūn (a.s.). — You know how much inclined are these people to evil.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>They came to me and insisted saying, something seems has happened to Mūsā, now make us a god, to guide us.<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>After that I said to bring golden earrings. Here, this was the result." <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-5"><sup>f</sup></span><span id="bookmarks24"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s4">"Who is on the side of Allāh (s.w.t.)?"</div></div><span id="bookmarks24"></span><a id="v25"></a>
<div class="p">So, people were out of control, and they had dishonoured themselves in front of their enemies.<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>Rasulullah came to the gate of the camp and shouted saying: "Who is on the side of Allāh (s.w.t.), come over here!" The fellows from the tribe of Lāwī gathered around him.<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>"This is the command of Allāh: each of you take your sword in your hand and kill the men in the camp. Whether he is your brother or relative, do not spare!" commanded nabī Mūsā.<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>So, on that day about three thousand men were slaughtered. <span class="zv">35 </span> Allāh punished Banī Isrāʾīl this way for making the golden calf.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-6"><sup>g</sup></span><span id="bookmarks28"></span></div><span id="bookmarks28"></span><a id="v30"></a>
<div class="p">The next day Mūsā (a.s.) said to the people: "Your sin is very heavy. Even then I will go to our Lord, maybe I will find kaffara for you."<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>Then he went to the presence of Allāh and begged saying: "The nation have committed very heavy sin, they have made an idol from gold for themselves.<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>Even so, please forgive their sin. If you do not forgive them, remove me too from Your list!"<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>Allāh said: "I will remove the people who committed sin from the list.<span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a>I will punish them in due time. <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-7"><sup>h</sup></span><span id="bookmarks34"></span></div>
