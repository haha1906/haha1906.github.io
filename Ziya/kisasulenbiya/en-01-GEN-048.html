<div class="s"><div id="s1">Ifrāyim and Minashshih in the Presence of their Grandfather</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Not long after this, Hazrat Yūsuf was told that his father had become very sick. So he took his sons Minashshih and Ifrāyim and went to see his father.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>Yaʿqūb (a.s.) heard that his son had come, so he gathered all of his strength and sat up in the bed where he was lying.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>Then he said to Yūsuf, "Almighty Allāh showed me his glory<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> in the town of Lūz in Kanʿān. He blessed me and said,<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>"I will increase the number of your descendants. A community of nations will come into existence from you. I will give this land to you and to your descendants as a permanent possession."<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Now I want to make your two sons born here, Ifrāyim and Minashshih, my own sons. Just like Raʾūbin and Samīʿun, they will also participate in receiving the inheritance from me.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>Your other children are yours: they will inherit from the share of Ifrāyim and Minashshih.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>I am doing this in memory of your mother Rāḥīl. When we were returning from Faddān Arām, your mother died on the way before reaching Ifrāt. I buried her there, on the road of Ifrāt."<span id="bookmarks7"></span></div><span id="bookmarks7"></span><a id="v8"></a>
<div class="p">Then he saw his grandchildren and asked, "Who are these boys?" He could not see well because of old age.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>Hazrat Yūsuf answered, "These are Minashshih and Ifrāyim, the sons Allāh gave me in Miṣr." Yaʿqūb (a.s.) said, "Bring them to me, let me give them my blessing."<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>Then he kissed his grandchildren and hugged them.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>He said, "I thought that I would never see you again. Now, Allāh has even let me see your children."<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>Then Hazrat Yūsuf bowed down to the earth before his father.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>Then he put his older son Minashshih at his father's right side, and the younger son Ifrāyim at his father's left side.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>But Yaʿqūb (a.s.) crossed his arms and put his right hand on the head of Ifrāyim, and his left hand on the head of Minashshih.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>Then he gave Hazrat Yūsuf his blessing and said, "May Allāh, who my grandfather Ibrāhīm and father Isḥāq worshipped, who took care of me throughout of my life,<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>who has been protecting me from all kinds of evil, may he bless your children. May the name of my grandfather Ibrāhīm and the name of my father Isḥāq and my name live in these children. May they have plenty of children and descendants!"<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>Hazrat Yūsuf did not like it that his father put his right hand on the head of Ifrāyim, and he tried to take his father's right hand from the head of Ifrāyim and put it on the head of Minashshih.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>"No, father," he said, "here is the oldest, put your right hand here."<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>But Hazrat Yaʿqūb refused. "I know, my son, I know," he said. "A great nation will come from Minashshih as well, but his younger brother Ifrāyim's descendants will become even greater. Many nations will come from his descendants."<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>So that day, Hazrat Yaʿqūb gave a blessing to Yūsuf's sons saying: "When the people of Isrāʾīl bless each other, they will say 'May Allāh make you blessed like Ifrāyim and Minashshih.' Thus they will mention your names always." In this way, he showed that Ifrāyim would be greater than Minashshih.<span id="bookmarks20"></span></div><span id="bookmarks20"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p">Then he said to Hazrat Yūsuf: "My time has come to say good-bye to this world. But Allāh will be with you. And he will take you back to Kanʿān, to the land of your forefathers."<span id="bookmarks21"></span></div>
