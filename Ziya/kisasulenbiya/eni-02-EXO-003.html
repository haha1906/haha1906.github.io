<div class="p">Mūsā (a.s.) was taking care of his father-in-law's sheep. One day he drove the flock across the desert, toward the mountain<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> which was on Tuwa.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>There Allāh (s.w.t.) made a fire appear to him. Sir Mūsā saw that a bush was burning, but it was not burned up in the fire!<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>"Wow, that is so strange!" Mūsā said to himself. "Why is the bush burning but not being consumed?"<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span> <span class="dc">"Then he said to his people, ‘Stay here––I can see a fire. Maybe I can bring you a flaming brand from it or find some guidance there.’"</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span> So he went closer to the bush.<span id="bookmarks3"></span></div><span id="bookmarks3"></span><a id="v4"></a>
<div class="p">At that moment a voice came out of the fire: "Mūsā! Mūsā!" "Labbay!" said Mūsā (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>"Stop, do not come any closer! Take off your sandals, because you are on holy ground.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>I am the Ilāh of your ancestors Ibrāhīm, Isḥāq and Yaʿqūb".<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-4"><sup>e</sup></span> Mūsā (a.s.) was afraid to look at the Light <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-5"><sup>f</sup></span> of Allāh and covered his face.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-6"><sup>g</sup></span><span id="bookmarks6"></span></div><span id="bookmarks6"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p">"My people are in suffering. They are crying out for help because of their overseers.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>I am Raḥmān. The time has come to rescue My people from the grip of the Miṣriyyūn. I will lead them to Kanʿān — to a land where there is plenty of honey and milk.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v10"></a>Get prepared. I will send you to Miṣr, to Firʿawn. You will take my people, Banī Isrāʾīl, out of Miṣr."<span id="bookmarks10"></span></div><span id="bookmarks10"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p">Allāh is al-raḥmān al-raḥīm. He saw that Banī Isrāʾīl was suffering in slavery and he had mercy on them. <span class="dc">"Go to Firʿawn, for he has truly become a tyrant."</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-7"><sup>h</sup></span><span id="bookmarks9"></span></div><span id="bookmarks9"></span><a id="v11"></a>
<div class="p">"Who am I to go to Firʿawn?!" said Hazrat Mūsā. "How can I take Banī Isrāʾīl out of Miṣr?"<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>"I will be with you, I will support you," said Allāh (s.w.t.). "You (plural) will leave Miṣr and come here. On this mountain you (plural) will worship Me. That will be the proof that I have sent you."<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>Then Mūsā (a.s.) asked, "If Banī Isrāʾīl asks: "Who is our God? What can he do?", what will I say?"<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-8"><sup>i</sup></span><span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>Allāh (s.w.t.) said: "I am al-Qayyūm<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-9"><sup>j</sup></span>.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>This name of Mine will be remembered for many generations.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>Go, and gather the elders. Tell them: "Al-Qayyūm — God (literally: ilāh) of our fathers Ibrāhīm and Isḥāq and Yaʿqūb appeared to me and told me this: 'I stand here watching your condition in Miṣr.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>As I had promised, I will bring you out of this house of suffering and I will take you to a land where there is plenty of honey and milk.'"<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>They will accept your word. Then go to Firʿawn together and tell him this: "Allāh intends to meet with us.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-10"><sup>k</sup></span> He commanded us to travel three days journey to the desert and offer sacrifices to Him there."<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>But Firʿawn will not give permission for you to go.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>Then I will demonstrate My power and My miracles. I will shower disasters on the Miṣriyyūn. Then he will be forced to let you go."<span id="bookmarks20"></span></div>
