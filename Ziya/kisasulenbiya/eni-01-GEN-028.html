<div class="p">Isḥāq (a.s.) called Yaʿqūb to himself and blessed him. Then he said: "I do not want you to marry a Kanʿāni woman.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>Go right now to the house of your grandfather Bitūʾil, to Faddān Arām. Go marry one of your uncle Lābān's daughters.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>May Allāh (s.w.t.) bless you very much, and give you many children! May your descendants multiply and you become a community of peoples!<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>May you and your descendants get the blessing promised to your grandfather Ibrāhīm and possess the land of Kanʿān, this land where we live as strangers!"<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Saying these words, Prophet Isḥāq sent Yaʿqūb to Faddān Arām, to his uncle Lābān.<span id="bookmarks5"></span></div><span id="bookmarks5"></span><a id="v6"></a>
<div class="p">Easu noticed that his father was fed up with the Kanʿāni daughters in law and sent Yaʿqūb to Faddān Arām with blessing, saying, 'do not marry a Kanʿāni woman.'<span id="bookmarks6-8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>So ʿIsāw went to the tribe of his uncle Ismāʿīl and married Māḥalat, the daughter of Ismāʿīl (a.s.), the sister of Nibayūt.<span id="bookmarks9"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s1">Yaʿqūb's (a.s.) dream</div></div><span id="bookmarks9"></span><a id="v10"></a>
<div class="p">Meanwhile, Yaʿqūb left his father's house in Biʾr Sabʿ and went toward Ḥārān, where his uncle lived.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>At sunset, he found a place and decided to spend the night there. He put his head on one of the stones and went to sleep.<span id="bookmarks11"></span></div><span id="bookmarks11"></span><a id="v12"></a>
<div class="p">As he slept he saw a dream of a staircase. One end of the staircase was on the earth, the other end was on the highest <span class="wa">arsh</span>. Allāh's angels were going up and down on the staircase.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>Then Allāh (s.w.t.) spoke to Yaʿqūb from the <span class="wa">arsh</span>: "I am the Allāh who made a covenant with your grandfather Ibrāhīm and your father Isḥāq. The land where you are lying belongs to you. I am giving it to you and to your descendants.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>You will have many descendants -- as many as the sands on the earth. You (plural) will spread to the West to the East, to the North to the South. All the tribes on the earth will become <span class="wa">wāris</span> of the blessing through you and your <span class="wa">zurriyya</span>.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>I am with you. Wherever you go, I will protect you. When the time comes, you will return to this land. I won't forsake you. I will be with you, and I will fulfill all of My promises I have spoken.<span id="bookmarks15"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">The Promises given to Yaʿqūb (a.s.)</div></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">So Allāh (s.w.t.) promised three things to Yaʿqūb (a.s.) also:</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">&nbsp; that he will have many descendants, </span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">&nbsp; his descendants will possess the earth/land,</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">&nbsp; and through his descendant Allāh will distribute the blessing to all nations on the earth. If you remember Allāh promised the same things to the prophet Ibrāhīm and Isḥāq (a.s.). </span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">Yaʿqūb (a.s.) takes a vow</div></div><span id="bookmarks15"></span><a id="v16"></a>
<div class="p">Yaʿqūb (a.s.) woke up and said with surprise: "This place turned out to be a holy place! I was not aware of that!"<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>Then he became afraid and said: "This place seems to be indeed a gate which takes you up to the <span class="wa">Arsh</span>!"<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>The next morning, Yaʿqūb got up early. He took the stone which was under his head, stood it vertical, and poured olive oil on top of it. In this way he dedicated it to Allāh (s.w.t.)<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>and named that place Bītʾīl<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span>(its previous name was Lūz.)<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>Then he made a vow and said: "If Allāh will be with me and protect me on the road, and gives me food to eat, and clothes for my body,<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>and brings me back to my father's house in peace, I will serve only Him.<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>The place where I had put the stone will be Baytullah. Then whatever Allāh gives me, I will give a tenth of it."</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Allāh (s.w.t.) gave a revelation to prophet Yaʿqūb through the dream. Just imagine if there was a staircase going from the earth to the place where Allāh (s.w.t.) is! We could go up and see many things, and understand many things, don't you think? May be we would see Paradise!? What do you think? </span><span id="bookmarks22"></span></div>
