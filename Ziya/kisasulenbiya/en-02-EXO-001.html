<div class="mt"><span class="mt">The story of Mūsā (a.s.)</span></div>
<div class="b"></div>
<div class="b"></div><a id="v6"></a>
<div class="p">After the death of nabī Yūsuf, about 320 years passed by.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>During this period the children of Yaʿqūb (a.s.) increased rapidly and became a large people group.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>Then a new king came to the throne of Miṣr. He did not know about Yūsuf (a.s.), or about the service he had done for Miṣr.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span><span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>He said to his own people: "The number of Isrāʾīliyyūn in our land is constantly increasing.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>If we do not do something, they will become much stronger than us. If war begins, they might fight against us and go to the side of enemy, or they may leave our land".<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span><span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>After that, the Miṣriyyūn began to oppress Banī Isrāʾīl with hard labor. So they put overseers over them. (The towns al-Fayyūm and ʿAyn Shams in Miṣr were built in those difficult days.)</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Can you imagine what it would be like to be a slave? First, you would have to work from morning until night. Second, you could not eat whatever you want nor wear whatever you want. You would be considered the property of the slavemaster. Third, the slavemaster could whip you whenever he wants. The worst thing about that situation is that there is no hope that your life would change and get better. Your hands and legs would be shackled, you could not set yourself free! How could you become free? One way is if your owner sets you free. But almost never happens. The second way is if you have rich relatives, they can buy you by paying money for you.</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">You know, sin is also like shackles. A man who is trapped by the shackles of sin does not have enough strength to break them off. Have there been situations when you did not want to do something bad, but you did not have enough strength, and so you did it again and again? Where can you get help from? From your father? Your brothers? No! You must pray to Allāh and seek the salvation from him. If you ask with all of your heart, Allāh (s.w.t.) certainly will help you.</span><span id="bookmarks11"></span></div><span id="bookmarks11"></span><span id="bookmarks11"></span><a id="v12"></a>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">Though the oppression of the Miṣriyyūn was constantly growing, the number of Banī Isrāʾīl was also increasing day by day. The Miṣriyyūn were worried about this and started oppressing them even more harshly.<span id="bookmarks12-14"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s1">The order given to the midwives</div></div><span id="bookmarks12-14"></span><a id="v15"></a>
<div class="p">Then Firʿawn called the ʿIbrāniy midwives and gave them these orders:<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>"When the ʿIbrāniyyīna give birth: If the child is a girl, let her live. But if it is a boy, then kill him."<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>But the midwives feared Allāh (s.w.t.). So they did not obey Firʿawn and did not kill the boys who were being born.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>Then Firʿawn called them to his presence and asked, "Why did you not obey my orders? Why are you allowing the male babies to live?"<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>"Your Majesty!" they replied, "It is not our fault. ʿIbrāniy women are not weak like the Miṣriyyūn. They give birth before the midwives get there. We are not able to do anything", they answered.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>In this way, Banī Isrāʾīl continued to increase and became a big people group.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>Then, because the midwives had the fear of Allāh in their hearts, Allāh (s.w.t.) took them under His mercy and gave them children.<span id="bookmarks21"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">More oppression <span class="dc">"Firʿawn’s people, who subjected you to terrible torment, slaughtering your sons and sparing only your women..."</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Baqara 2:49</span>).</div></div><span id="bookmarks21"></span><a id="v22"></a>
<div class="p">Then Firʿawn commanded all the Miṣriyyūn: "Throw every male baby born from the ʿIbrāniyyūn into the river Nīl, but let the female babies live."</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Can you imagine? Put yourself in their place. Imagine the mothers crying. Try to understand the fathers who could not do anything. Can you imagine? This was a great crime committed by one nation against another.</span><span id="bookmarks22"></span></div>
