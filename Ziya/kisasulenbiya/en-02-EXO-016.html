<div class="mt"><div id="mt1">The events that happened with Banī Isrāʾīl in the desert <span class="dc">"We made those who had been oppressed (Banī Isrāʾīl) succeed to both the east and the west of the land that We had blessed"</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Aʿrāf 7:137</span>)</div></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">So, under Allāh (s.w.t.)'s guidance Banī Isrāʾīl started on the journey towards the Promised Land. The distance from Miṣr to Kanʿān was not too far, it would only take a few weeks by riding on an animal. But for the people of Allāh (s.w.t.) a few week's travel was extended for forty years.</span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s1">Quarrel for food</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Then the community of Isrāʾīl left Īlīm and arrived at the desert of Sīn between Īlīm and Saynāʾ. It was one and a half months since they left Miṣr.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>When they came to the desert of Sīn, the people started complaining against Hazrat Mūsā and Hārūn (a.s.), and they said to Mūsā, "We should not have left Miṣr. It would have been a thousand times better if Allāh (s.w.t.) had killed us in Miṣr. At least we could eat meat there as much as we wanted. But you have brought us to the desert and now we are going to die from starvation."<span id="bookmarks2-3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>Then Allāh (s.w.t.) said to nabī Mūsā: "I will rain bread for you from the sky. The people should go out every day and gather their share for that day. Through this I will test My people. Let us see: will they follow My instructions or not?"<span id="bookmarks4"></span></div><span id="bookmarks4"></span><a id="v6"></a>
<div class="p">Then Mūsā (a.s.) and Hārūn (a.s.) went and gathered all the people and told them: "Allāh (s.w.t.) brought you out of Miṣr, not we. And it is Allāh (s.w.t.) who will give you food, not we. You are not standing against us, but against Allāh (s.w.t.). He will feed you to your satisfaction with meat in the evening, and tomorrow with bread. Will you really not come to your sense even after these signs/āyāt? Be aware that you are surely complaining against Allāh (s.w.t.)!"<span id="bookmarks6-8"></span> <a id="v10"></a>At that time, right before the eyes of the people the bright light of Allāh appeared in the appearance of a cloud<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>and a revelation came to Mūsā (a.s.):<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>"I have heard the complaints of Banī Isrāʾīl. Tell them, in the evening you will eat meat, and in the morning I will fill your stomach with bread. Then you will know that I am your provider-God."<span id="bookmarks12"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Food rained from the sky <span class="dc">"We made the clouds cover you with shade, and sent manna and quails down to you, saying, ‘Eat the good things We have provided for you.’ It was not Us they wronged; they wronged themselves."</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Baqara 2:57</span>)</div></div><span id="bookmarks12"></span><a id="v13"></a>
<div class="p">In the evening quails came and filled the whole camp. And in the morning dew covered (the ground) around the camp.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>When dew disappeared, tiny flakes appeared on the ground. It looked somewhat like frost.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>People were asking each other: "What is it?" The messenger of Allāh said to them: "This is the bread of God He gave you to eat.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>Everybody gather what is enough. Pick it one <span class="wa">amir</span> per person. Allāh (s.w.t.) commanded this!"<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>People did as it was said. The families who had more members gathered more, and those with fewer members gathered less. When they measured, those who gathered more did not have any extra, and those who gathered less had no lack. Everybody gathered just enough for his family. <span class="zv">31 </span> (The colour of the bread baked from this flour was whitish like the seed of coriander, and its taste was like bread baked with honey.)</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">The life of a human being is not free from difficulties. Sometimes we have to pass through "deserts", and suffer from hunger as well. There are times when you may think "Do I really have faith or not?" </span><span id="bookmarks17-18"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">Gather the provision only for one day</div></div><span id="bookmarks17-18"></span><a id="v19"></a>
<div class="p">At that time the prophet Mūsā said this to the people also: "Allāh (s.w.t.) will keep giving you your daily food every day. This is why you should not save the flour for tomorrow to eat. Tomorrow Allāh will give your share of food again! Every day take just enough for one day."<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>But some people did not pay attention to what Mūsā (a.s.) said, and they kept part of the gathered flour for the next day. When they looked at it the next day, they saw that their flour had worms and was spoiled.</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">What do you think: why did not they obey Allāh (s.w.t.)'s command? It is not easy to give your future over to Allāh (s.w.t.). This is because the thing we call 'worry' has its own power. Are there things that worry you? What are they? Which of them can you hand over to Allāh (s.w.t.) today?</span><span id="bookmarks20"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s4">A share of food for the day of rest</div></div><span id="bookmarks20"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p">Every morning the people gathered as much flour as they needed for themselves. When the day got warm, the rest of the flour left on the ground melted.<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>On the sixth day they saw that they had gathered two times as much flour! When they saw this, the elders of the people came to the prophet Mūsā and asked what happened.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>Rasulullah said to the elders, "Allāh (s.w.t.) says: Tomorrow is the seventh day, the day of rest. Allāh (s.w.t.) has set aside one day to have rest. That is why you should cook today what you need for tomorrow too. Boil today what what you need to boil. Eat part of the cooked food today, and eat the rest of it tomorrow".<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>After that, the people kept part of the food for the next day, as Rasulullah commanded. On that day the food did not stink or have worms.<span id="bookmarks24"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s5">The seventh day is the day of rest</div></div><span id="bookmarks24"></span><a id="v25"></a>
<div class="p">In the evening Rasulullah gathered the people and said, "Tomorrow is the day of rest. For that reason, the bread will not rain from the sky tomorrow.<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>You will gather bread six days of the week, but on the seventh day there will not be bread there outside."<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>Even after he said this, some people went outside the next day to gather flour, but they did not find anything.<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>Then Allāh (s.w.t.) sent a revelation to Mūsā (a.s.) and said, "How much longer will you refuse to obey My commands and guidance? Do not forget that I appointed a day of rest for you.<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>That is why on the sixth day I am giving you your share of food for two days. On the seventh day, you should rest. Nobody should go out to gather flour."<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>From this time on, the nation started to have rest on the seventh day.<span id="bookmarks30"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s6">***</div></div><span id="bookmarks30"></span><a id="v35"></a>
<div class="p">Up until the time the descendants of the prophet Yaʿqūb reached the promised land, flour always rained from the sky for 6 days a week.<span id="bookmarks35"></span> <a id="v33"></a>Later, by the order of Allāh (s.w.t.), Hārūn (a.s.) put some of this flour into a dish and put it inside the Tābūt al-ʿAhd<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> for the future generations to see and remember.<span id="bookmarks33-34"></span> <a id="v35"></a>Until Banī Isrāʾīl entered the promised land — Kanʿān, they survived by eating the heavenly bread for forty years.<span id="bookmarks35"></span></div>
