<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">This book follows the tradition that is called "<span class="it">Qiṣaṣ al-Anbiyāʾ</span>" in Arabic, which are books that tell the history of the prophets (a.s). There are several books that were written in this group of literature. The first of them is the collection written by Muḥammad Ibn Isḥāq. He dedicated his work to three topics: the creation of the world and the history of the prophets before Muḥammad (s.a.w.) (<span class="it">Kitāb al-mubtadaʾ</span>); the life of our prophet (s.a.w.) and the revelations he had recieved (Sira); and his military advances ("<span class="it">maghāzī</span>"). Unfortunately, the book of Ibn Isḥāq was lost. However, some scholars mentioned the words/writing of Ibn Isḥāq many times. For example, al-Ṭabarī wrote about Ibn Isḥāq's book in his tafsīr and in his book about the history of the world (see: <span class="it">Tārīkh al-rusul wa-l-mulūk</span>). In particular, the ideas and the form of al-Ṭabarī's history book was strongly influenced by Ibn Isḥāq.</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">Another writer who wrote about <span class="it">Qiṣaṣ al-Anbiyāʾ</span> was a Yemeni, Wahb Ibn Munabbih, who was originally from Persia. He compiled/put together a collection of books telling the history of the lives of prophets. He knew Hebrew and Aramaic as well as Arabic and could read the books of <span class="it">Tawrāt </span>and <span class="it">Zabūr </span>in the original languages. That is why he described the history of the ancient prophets with strong <span class="wa">dalils</span> and <span class="wa">hujja</span>.<span id="bookmarks3"></span></div><span id="bookmarks3"></span><span id="bookmarks3"></span><a id="v4"></a>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">Another collection of <span class="it">Qiṣaṣ al-Anbiyāʾ</span> belongs to Isḥāq Ibn Bishr from Khorasan. He wrote a book about the history of prophets called "<span class="it">Mubtadaʾ al-dunya wa qiṣaṣ al-anbiyāʾ</span>" (which means, "The beginning of the world and the history of the prophets"). Until recently this book was considered lost, but fortunately just a few years ago the first part of the book was found. This manuscript narrates/tells about the world's creation, the story of Ibrāhīm (a.s.) and stories of the prophets that lived before him.</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">The next collection of <span class="it">Qiṣaṣ al-Anbiyāʾ</span> belongs to Abū Isḥāq al-Thaʿlabī. Al-Thaʿlabī was an analytic scholar who lived 400 years after Muḥammad (s.a.s.). The tafsīrs that he wrote about heavenly scriptures were of high scientific importance, they didn't become very popular. The next writer is Al-Haysam b. Muḥammad al-Bushanji. His collection of "<span class="it">Qiṣaṣ al-Qurʾān</span>" in Arabic is worthy of special attention. That book describes the history of the prophets mentioned in the Qurʾān, legends about the prophets, and also the life of nabī Muḥammad (s.a.w.). Aḥmād b. Abū Uzayba from Baytul-Muqaddas also collected <span class="it">Qiṣaṣ al-Anbiyāʾ</span>, but only one of his manuscripts has survived until today.<span id="bookmarks4"></span></div><span id="bookmarks4"></span><span id="bookmarks4"></span><a id="v5"></a>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">Among non-Arab authors, perhaps the most important book was written by Nasiruddin Rabguzi in the Turkish language. He wrote many stories about the prophets that include detailed legends and narrations. Later, Ibn Taymiya and his student Ibn Kathīr investigated the books of <span class="it">Qiṣaṣ al-Anbiyāʾ</span>that existed at that time. They rejected some narrations, especially the ones that were influenced by Jews and Christians. (We have to admit, though, that for the last 100 years, the collection of Ibn Kathīr has had a great impact on many people.)</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">Yes, the books of <span class="it">Qiṣaṣ al-Anbiyāʾ</span> -- which have been passed down from generation to generation -- are still very popular. "The stories of the prophets" are being published again and again in Arab, Farsi and Turkish speaking nations. For example, the <span class="it">Qiṣaṣ al-Anbiyāʾ</span>of al-Sharawī from Miṣr is also very popular. That book consists of more than 3,000 pages in 5 volumes. It describes the history of the prophets in a modern way and it includes a lot of information.</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p">Until now, the history of the prophets were published many times in Arabic, Farsi and Turkish languages. But, unfortunately, in our language this kind of literature has not been available. That's why we decided to present some information about the lives of the prophets. This series has been collected by Shaykhs of the tariqa. For the sake of Allāh, they have looked for Ḥikma in ancient traditions and writings, with careful attention to the Qurʾān al-Karīm and the Sunna of the Prophet. They studied the biographies of prophets from ancient reliable sources and did analyses of verses of Qurʾān al-Karīm. They also considered the commentaries of great Islamic scholars like al-Ṭabarī, Ibn Isḥāq, Ibn Khaldūn and al-Yaʿqūbī. We have translated it to the best of our ability into our language. Inshallah this collection of <span class="it">Qiṣaṣ al-Anbiyāʾ</span> will give inspiration to your heart, give you examples of goodness and uprightness, and will lead you to a life of <span class="wa">taqwā</span>.</div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Introduction</div></div><span id="bookmarks5"></span><a id="v6"></a>
<div class="p">Life is like traveling on a road, isn't it? Ever since you came into this world, you have been moving in a certain direction. Even a person who says 'I am not going anywhere' changes from one time to time, goes from one mood to to another, and from one relationship to another relationship. Life is a very interesting journey. Everybody travels differently on the road called life. Because roads are not free from danger, sometimes you may face unpleasant events. But the worst thing for you is to be on the wrong path, because the wrong path will not take you to a good destination. Going in the wrong direction leads to destruction. Then the question is: what is the right path?<span id="bookmarks6"></span></div><span id="bookmarks6"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p">It is good/preferable if you have a trustworthy traveller with you when you are on the road. Today you have the opportunity to start out on a new "journey". And your closest fellow-traveller is Allāh Almighty Himself. Who is He to you? How will He treat you? Do you know Him well?<span id="bookmarks7"></span></div><span id="bookmarks7"></span><a id="v8"></a>
<div class="p">The main theme to learn in Taṣawwuf is maʿrīfatullah, i.e. <span class="bd">knowing who this most great person is</span>. Even worldly people know that He exists.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>Some think He is like a generous, harmless and agreeable old man. Some think He is cruel like an angry judge. Some do not think anything about Him, and they also are not afraid of Him.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>But some worry day and night trembling from fear, worrying about how to escape the suffering that Allāh may impose. Who do you think He is?<span id="bookmarks10"></span></div><span id="bookmarks10"></span><a id="v11"></a>
<div class="p">From ancient times He has been sending His prophets to the Earth, so that His servants may know Him. The man who knows the messages of Allāh will also understand who Allāh is, but only to the degree that He has revealed himself. In order to know who Allāh is we should also learn about <span class="it">what He did in the past </span> and how He dealt with human beings.<span id="bookmarks11"></span></div><span id="bookmarks11"></span><a id="v12"></a>
<div class="p">Let me give you an example from the natural world: What would you say if someone came and made an offer to you saying, "Let's go to a neighbouring country to work"?<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>I imagine that you might think about the character of this man, what kind of deeds he has been doing till now, and how he has treated other people. Isn't that right?<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>But why should you think about his past life when you are talking about working together with him in the future?!<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>Well, the answer is quite simple: it is easier to trust someone to be faithful in the future if he indeed was faithful before. Isn't that right? And the past (that is, history) explains to us more clearly who Allāh is.<span id="bookmarks15"></span></div><span id="bookmarks15"></span><a id="v16"></a>
<div class="p">You should also realize that the road of Taṣawwuf is not just knowledge from books. We are not just learning abstract ideas. Allāh is going to interfere in your life!<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>Allāh Himself is calling you to this Path! You can know who He is through your own experience. If you know who Allāh is and if you live a life that is pleasing to Him, you can witness that He is wahid (one)!<span id="bookmarks17"></span></div><span id="bookmarks17"></span><a id="v18"></a>
<div class="p">Another theme in Taṣawwuf is about <span class="bd">who we are</span>. Many people think differently about this also.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>Who were we in the beginning? Where has sin taken us? What kind people should we become now?<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>Is it possible to get free from sinful desires?<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>What is the difference between new thinking and old thinking? These are just some of the questions we may ask.<span id="bookmarks21"></span></div><span id="bookmarks21"></span><a id="v22"></a>
<div class="p">There are many issues to talk about. For example, there are faith issues, spiritual beings (angels and servants of Shayṭān, for example), what the Last Day is like, what is life after death, and which the practices which are pleasing to Allāh... We'll talk about these things during our "journey". As we start learning this holy/high knowledge, may I wish you "Blessed be your <span class="wa">niya</span> /intention!" May Allāh the High guide you and may He grant you His mercy. May he give you blessedness in this life and in the next and may he let you behold His beauty! Amin.<span id="bookmarks22"></span></div><span id="bookmarks22"></span>
