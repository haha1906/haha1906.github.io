<div class="s"><div id="s1">The festival of Sacrifice</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Then Allāh (s.w.t.) commanded Mūsā and Hārūn (a.s.),<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>"Let this month be the first month of the year for you.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>Tell the people this: on the tenth day of this month each man should take a sheep or goat for his family.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>If one sheep would be too much for his family, let them share it with his closest neighbour, depending on the number of people in the family.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Be careful when choosing an animal — it must be one-year-old male without defects.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>You will take care of it until the fourteenth day of the month, and on the evening of the fourteenth day you will slaughter them.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>And you will smear its blood on the doorposts of the house where the meat is eaten.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>On that night you will roast all of the meat of the sacrifice on the fire, and you will eat it with bitter herbs and with bread baked without yeast.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>Do not eat it raw or boiled in water.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>Do not leave the cooked meat until morning. If any of it is left over, burn it with fire.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>Eat the meat in a hurry with your shirt edges gathered, your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand. This is the Sacrifice which delivers the heirs (<span class="wa">wāriths</span>).<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>That night the angel of Death will go throughout Miṣr. He will kill the first-born sons of Miṣriyyūn.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> All the ilāhayn of Miṣr will be shamed, because there is no other ilāh besides Me.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>The blood smeared on your doors will be the sign of the houses where you live. When death sees the blood, it will pass over you. The death will not harm you.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>That day will be a day of memory for you. Always celebrate it as a festival of Allāh (s.w.t.)."<span id="bookmarks14"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">The festival of Unleavened Bread</div></div><span id="bookmarks14"></span><a id="v15"></a>
<div class="p">"For seven days you will eat bread without yeast. On the first day get rid of all yeast from your houses. Whoever eats bread with yeast during these seven days should be driven out of the Banī Isrāʾīl.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>On the first day and on the seventh day, hold meetings of the community. During these days do not do any work except preparing food.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>One time each year, celebrate the festival called "The bread baked without yeast", because on that day I will bring all of you out of Miṣr. Let this always be a law for you to celebrate this day.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>Starting from the evening of the 14th day until the evening of the 21st day, you will eat bread without yeast.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>During these seven days let there be no yeast in your houses. If anyone eats something with yeast, whether he is one of your own or from a different nationality, he shall be driven out of the community of Isrāʾīl.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>Do not eat anything made with yeast. It does not matter where you are, you should eat bread made without yeast."<span id="bookmarks20"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">You will say "Allāh kept us alive because of a sacrifice"</div></div><span id="bookmarks20"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p">Then Hazrat Mūsā called all the elders of Isrāʾīl and told them: "Go and tell everybody this: each family should choose a lamb or young goat to sacrifice and slaughter it on the fourteenth day. Put its blood into basins.<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>Then take a bundle of hyssop herb and dip it in the blood which is in the basin, and wipe it on the two sides of the door and above it. Nobody shall leave the house until morning.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>When the angel of death comes to kill the Miṣriyyūn, he will see the blood and will not let the death enter your houses.<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>You and your children should keep and observe this festival always, as a commandment.<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>You should follow this even after entering the land Allāh (s.w.t.) has promised us.<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>When your children ask you, "What is the meaning of this ibādāt?"<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>you should say, "This is the ibādāt of sacrifice done for Allāh (s.w.t.). When Allāh sent the Angel of death, He avoided our houses and kept us alive."<span id="bookmarks27"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s4">The death of the firstborn</div></div>
<div class="p">When people heard the words of Mūsā (a.s.), they bowed down and expressed their gratitude. <a id="v28"></a>Then they went and did all the commands which had been said, without failing to do any part of them.<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>Finally, the appointed day also came. At midnight, starting from the first-born-son of Firʿawn who is the king of Miṣr, to the first-born-son of prisoners in the dungeon -- all of them died.<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>Everybody woke up in the house of Firʿawn, in the house of his officials, and in the shacks of the poor people: everybody got on their feet. A loud cry raised throughout the land of Miṣr, because there was no family which did not see death. <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> <span class="dc">"We showed Firʿawn all Our signs, but he denied them and refused [to change]."</span> (<span class="xdc">Tāʾ Hāʾ 20:56</span>)</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p">\it Yes, that day the angel of death only avoided the houses of the believers. This was because they had put their faith in Allāh and in His rasul, and they slaughtered sacrifices. The slaughtered sacrifices kept the children of Isrāʾīl safe and sound. Do you remember, what had saved the son of nabī Ibrāhīm from death? The sacrifice Allāh (s.w.t.) had appointed. Was it any kind of sacrifice? No. The sacrifice Allāh (s.w.t.) spoke about must be without defects and blemishes. You probably remember that Allāh (s.w.t.) Himself had provided the sacrifice to Ibrāhīm (a.s.).</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks30"></span><span id="bookmarks30"></span><a id="v31"></a>
<div class="p">That same night, Firʿawn had Mūsā and Hārūn (a.s.) brought to him and said, "Enough! Take your people and leave. Go and do ibādāt to your Ilāh.<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>Take your animals also. But please, pray for me!"<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>And the Miṣriyyūn were also urging them saying, "Leave quickly, otherwise we all will die!"<span id="bookmarks33"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s5">Leaving Miṣr <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span></div></div><span id="bookmarks33"></span><a id="v34"></a>
<div class="p">So the ʿIbrāniyyūn took the unleavened dough in basins wrapped with cloths.<span id="bookmarks34"></span> <a id="v37"></a>If one does not count women and children, there were about 600,000 men who started the journey on foot from ʿAyn Shams towards the town of Sukkūt.<span id="bookmarks37"></span> <a id="v39"></a>On the way they baked bread from the unleavened dough that they brought out of Miṣr. (They had no time to prepare bread because they had left Miṣr in a hurry.)<span id="bookmarks39"></span> <a id="v40"></a>The Banī Isrāʾīl lived in Miṣr for a total of 430 years.<span id="bookmarks40"></span> <a id="v41"></a>On the last day of the 430th year, all of them left Miṣr.<span id="bookmarks41"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s6">The commandments about the feast of Sacrifice</div></div><span id="bookmarks41"></span><a id="v43"></a>
<div class="p">Allāh (s.w.t.) gave down some other instructions-rules about the feast of Sacrifice:</div>
<div class="p">"A person who has not entered the covenant should not eat the meat slaughtered for sacrifice.<span id="bookmarks43"></span> <a id="v44"></a>Your slaves can eat from it, if they have been circumcised.<span id="bookmarks44"></span> <a id="v45"></a>The travellers and hired workers, must not eat from it.<span id="bookmarks45"></span> <a id="v46"></a>The meat of sacrifice must be eaten inside that house, and not even a piece of it should be taken out of the house. And none of its bones must be broken.<span id="bookmarks46"></span> <a id="v47"></a>All of the Banī Isrāʾīl must celebrate this festival.<span id="bookmarks47"></span> <a id="v48"></a>If a foreigner living among you wants to participate in this festival of Allāh (s.w.t.), he must first circumcise all the males in his family. Only after that he can participate in this festival, like someone born among you. No body who is not circumcised must eat from the sacrificial meat.<span id="bookmarks48"></span> <a id="v49"></a>This law is applicable for everyone, for you and for foreigners among you as well."<span id="bookmarks49"></span></div>
