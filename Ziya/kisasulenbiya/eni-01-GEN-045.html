<div class="s"><div id="s1">Yūsuf (a.s.) reveals his Identity</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Of course, Yūsuf (a.s.) could understand everything they were saying. When he could not hold himself any more, "Get out! All of you, get out!" he said, and sent all of his servants outside. Everybody left the room. When they were left alone, Yūsuf told his brothers who he really was.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>Then he began crying with such a loud voice, that the Miṣriyyūn standing outside heard him weeping and quickly informed Firʿawn about it.<span id="bookmarks2"></span></div><span id="bookmarks2"></span><a id="v3"></a>
<div class="p">"It's me, Yūsuf! I am Yūsuf!" he said to his brothers. "Is my father safe and sound?" But his brothers were frozen from fear. They were speechless.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>"Come closer," Yūsuf (a.s.) said. "I am the brother you sold into slavery in Miṣr.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Do not be upset! Do not blame yourselves because you sold me. It was Allāh who brought me here. He brought me here ahead of you in order to save your lives.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>The famine that started just two years ago will last five more years. There will be no harvest, no reaping and no gathering.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>Allāh sent me here ahead of you in order to save the line of descendants of Ibrāhīm, to save the souls of many people.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>Yes, it was not you, it was Allāh who brought me here. Allāh made me Firʿawn's main advisor, and he gave me the right to govern over all of Miṣr.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>Now go quickly to my father, and tell him that Allāh raised up his son Yūsuf as a governor of all Miṣr.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>Do not waste time. I want all of you to move to Miṣr, near me, because the famine will continue for five more years.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>If you do not move here, you all will starve! Tell my father this.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>It is me, Yūsuf! You can see it for yourselves. See, my brother Binyāmin is also a witness!<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>Describe this to my father, tell him all you saw. Tell him how much honor I have in Miṣr. Bring him here as soon as possible."<span id="bookmarks13"></span></div><span id="bookmarks13"></span><a id="v14"></a>
<div class="p">Then Hazrat Yūsuf cried as he embraced first his younger brother Binyāmin, and then his older brothers. Binyāmin also cried. After this, his older brothers had courage to speak with Hazrat Yūsuf.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span><span id="bookmarks14-15"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Firʿawn's Suggestion</div></div><span id="bookmarks14-15"></span><a id="v16"></a>
<div class="p">The information that Yūsuf's brothers had come quickly reached Firʿawn. Firʿawn was glad, and so were his officials.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>Then Firʿawn called Yūsuf (a.s.) to himself and said: "Tell your brothers<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>to move your father and all of their families to Miṣr. I will give them the best place in Miṣr, the most fruitful land.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>Send carts with your brothers so that your father, the women and the children can ride on them.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>Also, don't let them try to bring anything from Kanʿān: the best things of Miṣr will be yours."</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Yes, the king of Miṣr showed great respect and invited them to Miṣr. This is why later on, Bānī Isrāʾīl had the right to leave Miṣr if they wanted.</span><span id="bookmarks20"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">The Caravan Sets Out</div></div><span id="bookmarks20"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p">So, the sons of Yaʿqūb (a.s.) took the carts and food and went to Kanʿān.<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>Hazrat Yūsuf gave a set of clothes to each brother. But to Binyāmin he gave 5 sets of clothes and 300 pieces of silver<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span>.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>And to his father he sent the best things of Miṣr loaded on 10 donkeys. In addition to that, he sent his father grain, bread and other food products loaded on ten other donkeys.<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>He said good-bye to his brothers and told them, "Do not be afraid, everything will be very good".<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span><span id="bookmarks24"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s4">Good News!</div></div><span id="bookmarks24"></span><a id="v25"></a>
<div class="p">They left Miṣr and returned to their father Yaʿqūb (a.s.) in the land of Kanʿān.<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>As soon as they saw their father, they said: "Yūsuf is alive! He has become the governor of Miṣr!" Yaʿqūb (a.s.) did not believe them. <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span><span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>After he saw the carts sent by Yūsuf (a.s.) and heard everything Yūsuf (a.s.) had said, his spirit revived.<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>Yaʿqūb exclaimed, "My son is alive! My son Yūsuf is alive! I WILL go! Before I die I will go and see him!"<span id="bookmarks28"></span></div>
