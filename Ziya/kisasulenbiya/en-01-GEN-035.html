A second problem is that in English this sounds like a command. Of course, Allāh is not telling Yaʿqūb something that he must do by himself. It is a blessing. It is Allāh who will cause it to happen. He has the power and he will do it. This could also be translated: “I bless you so that your descendants will be very numerous.”</span></div>",

<div class="p">At that time a revelation was sent down from Allāh (s.w.t.): "Rise, go to Bītʾīl. There slaughter sacrifices to Me."<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>Hearing this Yaʿqūb (a.s.) told his household and his servants: "Get ready, change your clothes. Get rid of your pagan idols.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span><span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>We are going to Bītʾīl. We will do <span class="wa">ibāda</span> to Allāh who supported me in my difficult days. He has helped me wherever I went."<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>So he took all of his household and his servants, and went on a journey to do <span class="wa">ibāda</span>.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>As they were leaving, nobody from the towns and villages nearby dared to pursue them, because Allāh had put fear into their hearts.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v9"></a>After arriving at Bītʾīl, Allāh (s.w.t.) said to Yaʿqūb (a.s.):<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v11"></a>“I am Allāh who is able to do everything (al-Qadir). A nation will come into existence from you, even a community of nations! Kings will come into the world from your <span class="wa">naṣl</span>. Be fruitful<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> and multiply.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>I have given you the land your grandfather Ibrāhīm and your father Isḥāq inherited. It will belong to you and to your descendants after you."<span id="bookmarks12"></span></div><span id="bookmarks12"></span><a id="v16"></a>
<div class="p">Then Yaʿqūb (a.s.) left Bītʾīl and went on a journey toward Ifrāt.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span> On the way, the time came for Rāḥīl to have a baby and she gave a birth to her second son — Binyāmin.

Yaʿqūb (a.s.) buried her there, on the road to Ifrāt.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v27"></a>They kept travelling and finally they arrived at the place where Isḥāq (a.s.) lived, in the city of Ḥibrūn<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span>. (Hazrat Ibrāhīm also lived there before.)<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>Isḥāq (a.s.) lived 180 years and when he<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>died, his sons ʿIsāw and Yaʿqūb (a.s.) buried him together.<span id="bookmarks29"></span></div><span id="bookmarks29"></span>
