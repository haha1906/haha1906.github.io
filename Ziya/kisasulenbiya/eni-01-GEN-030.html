<div class="p">Rāḥīl was not able to have childen, and she was jealous of her sister. One day she even argued with her husband saying: "Give me a child, otherwise I will die!"<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>"What are you saying? Am I Allah? I can't give you children!" said Yaʿqūb (a.s.) angrily.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>Then Rāḥīl said: "Well, then sleep with my maidservant and let her bear children for me. That way I want can become a mother too."<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>So she gave her maidservant Bilhā to her husband as a wife.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Bilhā became pregnant and bore a son.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>Rāḥīl named the child Dān, saying: "Allāh has judged in my favor. He heard my prayers and gave me a child."<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>Then Bilhā became pregnant a second time and bore another son to Yaʿqūb (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>This time Rāḥīl named the boy Naftālī<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span>, saying: "I struggled hard with my sister and have won."<span id="bookmarks8"></span></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p">Since Liʾā had ceased bearing children, she also gave her maidservant Zilfā to her husband as a wife.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>Zilfā became pregnant and bore a son.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>Liʾā named the boy Ghād<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span>, saying: "My fortune has come!"<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>Then Zilfā bore another son.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>Liʾā said: "I am so happy! Now the women will call me happy", and named the child Āshīr<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span>.<span id="bookmarks13"></span></div><span id="bookmarks13"></span><a id="v14"></a>
<div class="p">During the wheat harvest season, Raʾūbin brought a bunch of love-grass from the wilderness and gave it to his mother Liʾā. Then Rāḥīl said to Liʾā: "Please give me also some of the love-grass your son found."<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>Liʾā said: "Is not it enough that you took away my husband? Now do you want to take away the love-grass that my son brought?" "Ok," said Rāḥīl, "Give me the love-grass, and in return you will lay with our husband tonight."<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>In the evening when Yaʿqūb (a.s.) returned from the wilderness, Liʾā came out to meet him and said: "Today you will sleep with me. I have bought you for one night with the love-grass my son found."<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>Yaʿqūb (a.s.) slept that night with Liʾā and Liʾā became pregnant and bore a son to Yaʿqūb the fifth time. Allāh had accepted Liʾā 's prayers.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>Then Liʾā named her son Yissākhār<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span> saying "Allāh has rewarded me because I gave my maidservant to my husband".<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>Then she became pregnant again and bore a son to Yaʿqūb (a.s.) the sixth time.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>And she said: "This is Allāh's gift to me. I bore six sons to my husband. Now he will value me", and she named him Zībūlūn<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-4"><sup>e</sup></span>.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>Then she bore a daughter and named her Dīnah.<span id="bookmarks21"></span></div><span id="bookmarks21"></span><a id="v22"></a>
<div class="p">Finally Rāḥīl's prayers were also answered:<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>she became pregnant and bore a son. She said: "Allāh has taken away my disgrace.<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>May He give me another son in addition to this." So she named the child Yūsuf<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-5"><sup>f</sup></span>.<span id="bookmarks24"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s1">Labān and Yaʿqūb (a.s.) make an agreement about work</div></div><span id="bookmarks24"></span><a id="v25"></a>
<div class="p">After the birth of Yūsuf, Hazrat Yaʿqūb said to his father-in-law: "Now give me permission so I can return to my father's land.<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>I will take my wives and children also. You know how much I served you for them!"<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>Labān said, "Do not leave. Allāh (s.w.t.) blessed me because of you. See, I have become rich. It would be better if you stay.<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>Tell me, and I will pay you for your work, whatever is necessary."<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>"You know very well how I served you, and how I took care of your sheep and cattle," said Hazrat Yaʿqūb,<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>"You did not have this many animals before I came. After I came, Allāh has blessed you very much. Your flocks and herds increased very much. I should also think about my own family needs now!"<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>Labān said, "How much do you want me to pay you?" Yaʿqūb replied, "I do not need your money.<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>But, I will take care of your sheep further anyway. I have only one condition: today we'll go and separate from the flocks all the speckled, spotted and black sheep, and the speckled and spotted goats. They will be my payment.<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>Afterwards, if you see any white sheep in my flock, or a goat which is not speckled or spotted, then you have the right to say that I have stolen it."<span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a>"I agree. Let it be as you say", said Labān<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-6"><sup>g</sup></span><span id="bookmarks34"></span> <a id="v35"></a>and that very day he went and separated the speckled, spotted and black sheep, and the speckled and spotted goats and told his sons: "You will take care of Yaʿqūb's sheep.<span id="bookmarks35"></span> <a id="v36"></a>Take the flock a three day journey away". So Yaʿqūb (a.s.) continued to shepherd his uncle's sheep.<span id="bookmarks36"></span></div><span id="bookmarks36"></span><a id="v37"></a>
<div class="p">While he was taking care of sheep, here is what he did: He cut some branches from almond trees, poplar trees and plane trees. He peeled off part of the bark to make white streaks.<span id="bookmarks37"></span> <a id="v38"></a>Then he put these branches next to the troughs where the animals drank water.<span id="bookmarks38"></span> <a id="v39"></a>When the animals came to drink, they used to mate in front of the branches, and then when they bore, the kid animals were born speckled or spotted.<span id="bookmarks39"></span> <a id="v40"></a>Yaʿqūb (a.s.) would separate them, and would turn the heads of other sheep/goats toward them when breeding.<span id="bookmarks40"></span> <a id="v41"></a>Whenever big and strong sheep mated, he would put the branches near the troughs, in front of the sheep,<span id="bookmarks41"></span> <a id="v42"></a>but when weak animals mated, he would not put the branches there.<span id="bookmarks42"></span> <a id="v43"></a>As a result, the animals belonging to Lābān were born weak, but the animals belonging to Yaʿqūb (a.s.) were born strong. In this way, Hazrat Yaʿqūb became very rich and owned many flocks, camels and donkeys, as well as male and female slaves.<span id="bookmarks43"></span></div><span id="bookmarks43"></span>
