<div class="s"><div id="s1">The birth of the prophet whom Allāh loved<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span></div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">In one of those days a boy was born in the tribe of Lāwī. The baby was very handsome. When his mother saw this, she hid him for three months.<span id="bookmarks1-2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>When it was impossible to hide him any longer, she took a reed basket and spread tar all over it. Then she put her son in it and left it among the reeds at the edge of the river Nīl.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>The baby's sister then stood looking at him from distance, watching to see what would happen to him.</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span class="dc">"(O Mūsā,) your sister went out, saying, 'I will tell you someone who will nurse him,' then We returned you to your mother so that she could rejoice and not grieve."</span> (<span class="xdc">Tā Hā 20:40</span>)
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks4"></span><span id="bookmarks4"></span><a id="v5"></a>
<div class="p">After some time the daughter of Firʿawn came to the river to take a bath. She looked and saw that there was a basket among the reeds. "Go and bring that basket," she said to one of her (female) servants.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>When she removed the cover of the basket, her eyes fell on the crying baby. "It is a ʿIbrāniy boy", she said and she felt pity for him.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>Then the baby's sister came running and asked, "Shall I bring someone from among the ʿIbrāniy women to nurse the baby?"<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span><span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>"Good, do it", said the daughter of Firʿawn. The girl went and brought her mother.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>"Take this baby and nurse him for me," said the daughter of Firʿawn. "I will pay you for your help".<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span></div>
<div class="p">So the baby returned to the bosom of his mother. \it Allāh (s.w.t.) says in Qurʾān al-Karīm: <span class="dc">"After that We returned you to your mother so that she could rejoice and not grieve..."</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span><span id="bookmarks9"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">"Who am I?"</div></div><span id="bookmarks9"></span><a id="v10"></a>
<div class="p">When the boy grew a little, his mother brough him back to Firʿawn's daughter. She adopted him and named him Mūsā, saying, "I pulled him out of the water".<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>Many years passed and Mūsā (a.s.) grew up. \it He knew who he was. Maybe he heard it from his mother who nursed him or maybe the people who wished evil told him (and wanted him out of the palace of Firʿawn). What we do know is that he knew about the history of his people and the covenant and the promises Allāh (s.w.t.) had given.<span id="bookmarks11"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">Escape from Miṣr <span class="dc">"(One day Mūsā) entered the city, unnoticed by its people, and found two men fighting: one from his own people, the other an enemy... Mūsā struck him with his fist and killed him. (Then he felt sorry and) said, ‘This must be Shayṭān’s work: clearly he is a misleading enemy.’"</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Qaṣaṣ 28:15</span>)</div></div>
<div class="p">One day Hazrat Mūsā went to visit his own people. There he saw one of the Miṣriyyūn beating anʿIbrāniy slave. <a id="v12"></a>He looked around and when he saw nobody around, he killed that Miṣriy and hid his corpse in the sand.<span id="bookmarks12"></span></div><span id="bookmarks12"></span><a id="v13"></a>
<div class="p">The next day he went again to his people. This time two ʿIbrāniyyūn were quarreling with each other. "Why are you hitting him?" asked Hazrat Mūsā. "We are brothers with each other, aren't we?"<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>The man answered, "It is not your business! Or are you going to kill me like you killed the Miṣriy?"<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-4"><sup>e</sup></span> Then Hazrat Mūsā became afraid because he realized that everybody knew that he had killed the Miṣriy.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>When Firʿawn heard about this, he ordered his people to catch Mūsā and kill him. Then Hazrat Mūsā fled to the land of Midyān.<span id="bookmarks15"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s4">In the tribe of ḥanīf Arabs <span class="dc">"Then you stayed among the people of Midyān for years."</span> (<span class="xdc">Tā Hā 20:40</span>).</div></div><span id="bookmarks15"></span><a id="v16"></a>
<div class="p">At that time there was a priest named Shuʿab living in Midyān<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-5"><sup>f</sup></span>. He had seven daughters. Every day the girls brought their father's sheep to the well to water them. Usually, just when they were about to water the sheep, other shepherds would come, chase them away and use the well for themselves. Once agin, as usual, the girls came with their sheep to the well. This time, Hazrat Mūsā was sitting at the well resting after the journey from Miṣr. When the girls were drawing water from the well and filling the troughs,<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>the shepherds came again. "Get out of here!" they said to the girls. "We will water our flocks first. Take your sheep away!" So Hazrat Mūsā stood up and chased the shepherds away. Then he helped the girls water their sheep. <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-6"><sup>g</sup></span><span id="bookmarks17"></span></div><span id="bookmarks17"></span><a id="v18"></a>
<div class="p">When the girls returned home, Shuʿab (a.s.) asked them, "What happened? You have come back very early today!"<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>"one of the Miṣriyyūn helped us," they said. "He protected us from the shepherds. Then he also drew water from the well and watered our sheep."<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-7"><sup>h</sup></span><span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>"Where is he?" Shuʿab (a.s.) said. "Why did you not ask him to come to our home? Go now and invite him to be a guest here."<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>In this way, Hazrat Mūsā began to live in that household. Then Shuʿab (a.s.) gave his daughter Ṣiffūrah to him in marriage.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-8"><sup>i</sup></span><span id="bookmarks21"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s5">Allāh (s.w.t.) decides to rescue His people</div></div><span id="bookmarks21"></span><a id="v23"></a>
<div class="p">Many years passed after that. The king of Miṣr died, but Banī Isrāʾīl were still suffering in slavery. Finally they started crying out to Allāh.<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>Then Allāh decided to free them, because He is raḥmān al-raḥīm. He had made a covenant in the past with the nabiyyūn Ibrāhīm, Isḥāq and Yaʿqūb.</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">If you remember, Allāh (s.w.t.) had promised them three things:</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">First, Allāh had said to the prophet Ibrāhīm that he would have many descendants. Indeed, the Banī Isrāʾīl increased to two or three millon from just seventy in the previous 400 years.</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">The second promise was about the land. </span> Allāh (s.w.t.) had said, "Your descendants will live as strangers in a foreign land for 400 years. They will be in slavery and will suffer oppression. Then I will take them out of that place. I will give that land to your descendants as their inheritance".</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">The third promise was about how all the nations of the earth will get a blessing through the <span class="wa">zurriyya</span> of Ibrāhīm (a.s.).</span> Allāh (s.w.t.) promised Hazrat Ibrāhīm: "Because you obeyed Me, I will give a blessing to all the nations of the Earth through your zurriyya."</div>
<div class="p"></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">As you see, the first promise was fulfilled by the time of nabī Mūsā. The descendants of nabī Yaʿqūb became a large nation. Now Allāh (s.w.t.) was going to fulfill His second promise.</span><span id="bookmarks24-25"></span></div>
