<div class="p">When the time came for the brothers to go home, Hazrat Yūsuf instructed his palace manager saying: "Fill their sacks with grain to the maximum. Then put everybody's money in the mouth of their sacks.<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>Also put my silver cup into the youngest one's sack."<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>When morning came, all of them took their donkeys and started on their journey.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>When they were still not too far off, Yūsuf (a.s.) said to his palace manager: "Now quickly go after them. When you catch them, say: Why did you repay kindness with evil?<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Why did you steal my master's cup?<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>The palace manager quickly went after them. When he caught up with them, he repeated the words his master had told him to say.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>They replied, "What are you saying? We would never do such a thing!<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>We have even brought you the money we found in our sacks last time. So why would we steal something from the house of your master?<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>Go ahead and check. If any of us have the thing you mentioned, you have the right to kill him, and the rest of us will be slaves for your master."<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>"Very good. If the cup is found, I will enslave him and keep him. The rest of you can go on your way," said the palace manager.<span id="bookmarks10"></span></div><span id="bookmarks10"></span><a id="v11"></a>
<div class="p">All of them quickly put their sacks down and opened them up.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>The palace manager started searching everybody's sack, starting from the oldest brother. The cup, of course, was in Binyāmin's sack.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>The brothers were terribly upset and cried out in sorrow. Then they loaded their sacks on their donkeys, and returned to the city with the palace manager.</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">(What do you think, why did Yūsuf (a.s.) do this?)</span><span id="bookmarks13"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Yahūdā (a.s.) offers Himself <span class="dc">They said, "Mighty governor, he has an elderly father. Take one of us in his place. We see that you are a very good man."</span> (<span class="xdc">Yūsuf, 12:78</span>).</div></div>
<div class="p">When they came back to the city, <a id="v14"></a>Yūsuf (a.s.) was still in his palace. The brothers came and fell to the ground before Hazrat Yūsuf.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>"What is this you have done?" said Yūsuf. "Did you not think that a powerful man like me is able to reveal secrets?"<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>Yahūdā replied, "Oh my lord! We do not know even how to answer. How do we defend ourselves? Allāh is punishing us for the sin we have done. Now all of us will be your slaves, including our brother from whom the silver cup was found."<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>"No," said Hazrat Yūsuf. "I will enslave only the man who stole the cup. The others will go home."<span id="bookmarks17"></span></div><span id="bookmarks17"></span><a id="v18"></a>
<div class="p">Then Yahūdā stepped forward and said, "My lord, I know you have power like Firʿawn does. Please do not be angry, and let me say something.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>When you asked us: 'Is your father alive, and do you have other brothers?',<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>we said, 'We have an old father. We were twelve brothers. The youngest is our father's son, who was born in his old age and is at home now. His brother died and now he is the only brother we have from that wife of our father.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>This is why our father loves him very much.' Then you said, 'Go and bring that brother to me, I want to see him with my eyes.'<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>We said, 'If we separate him from his father, his father will die.'<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>But you said, 'If you do not bring your youngest brother, do not show up.'<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>When we went to our father, we told him what you said.<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>Then later on our father said, 'Go back again and buy more grain.'<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>We said, 'No, if you do not give permission for your youngest son to go, we cannot go to Miṣr. The governor of Miṣr said that if we do not bring our youngest brother, we should not even show up.'<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>Then our father said to us, 'You know, Rāḥīl bore me two sons.<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>I lost one of them. He went and did not return. He became food for wild animals, obviously, and I never saw him again.<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>Now if you take this one as well, and if something happens to him, you will send me to the grave alive."<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>My lord, if we go now to our father, and if his youngest son is not with us,<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>my father will die from a broken heart.<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>His life is hanging on this boy. I guaranteed my father that I would bring our youngest brother safe and sound. I told him, 'If I don't bring him back to you, I will bear the blame forever.'<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>So my lord, I beg you, please, make me a slave instead of my younger brother. Let the boy return to his father.<span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a>How can I go to my father without my younger brother? How can I watch this disaster happen to my father?!"<span id="bookmarks34"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">The Brothers remember their Father's Grief</div></div>
<div class="p">\it Yūsuf (a.s.) said: "NO!" <span class="dc">Allāh forbid that we should take anyone other than the person on whom we found our property. That would be unjust of us."</span></div>
<div class="p">When <span class="it">(his brothers)</span> <span class="dc">lost hope of [persuading] him, they withdrew to confer with each other: The eldest of them said, "Do you not (<span class="it">brothers</span>) remember that your father took a solemn pledge from you in the name of Allāh and (that) before that you failed in your duty with regard to Yūsuf? I will not leave this land until my father gives leave or Allāh decides for me. He is the best decider. So go back to your father (<span class="it">without me</span>) and say, 'Your son stole. We can only tell you what we saw. How could we guard against the unseen? Ask in the town where we have been; we are telling the truth.</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">(Remember, how our father grieved when we left Samīʿun. He couldn't stop thinking about Yūsuf.)</span> <span class="dc">He said: "No, your nafs has prompted you to do wrong! But it is best to be patient: may Allāh bring all of them back to me-- He alone is the All Knowing, the All Wise,’ and he turned away from them, saying, ‘Alas for Yūsuf!’ His eyes went white with grief and he was filled with sorrow..."</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">(He was convinced that our brother Yūsuf was still alive.)</span> <span class="dc">He said, ‘I plead my grief and sorrow before God. I have knowledge from God that you do not have. Go and seek news of Yūsuf and his brother..."</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span></div>
