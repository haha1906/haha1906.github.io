<div class="s"><div id="s1">The second plague</div></div>
<div class="m"><span class="zv">7:25 </span> After one week passed by, <a id="v1"></a>Allāh (s.w.t.) said to Mūsā (a.s.): "Go to Firʿawn and tell him, 'give us permission to leave.'<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>Tell him that Allāh (s.w.t.) commanded you saying: 'Let My people go. Otherwise, I will fill al-Nīl with frogs.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>The frogs will swarm into your people's houses, your palace, your bedroom and your mattresses. Even the cooking pots will be filled with frogs'".<span id="bookmarks3-4"></span></div><span id="bookmarks3-4"></span><a id="v5"></a>
<div class="p">But Firʿawn did not listen. So Allāh (s.w.t.) said to nabī Mūsā: "Tell Hārūn to take the staff and stretch it over the river and lakes. Let the land of Miṣr be filled with frogs."<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>And that is what happened.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>But the magicians of Miṣr also did the same thing using their magic: they made frogs come out of water onto dry land. Frogs were everywhere.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>Then Firʿawn called Mūsā and Hārūn (a.s.) into his presence and said: "Pray to Allāh to take the frogs away from us. Then I will give you permission to go to the desert to do <span class="wa">ibādāt</span>."<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>Nabī Mūsā replied, "Please, set the time yourself -- when should I pray for you?"<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>"Tomorrow", said Firʿawn. "Good, let it be as you have said," replied nabī Mūsā. "By this you will know that nobody is equal to our Rabb Allāh!"<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v12"></a>Then he left the palace and he prayed to Allāh.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>His prayer was accepted and all the frogs which were on the dry land died.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>The people gathered dead frogs up in heaps. The land of Miṣr stank because of them.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>When the Firʿawn saw that he was free from the frogs, he made his heart hard like stone once again and did not fulfill<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> his promise.<span id="bookmarks15"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">The third plague</div></div><span id="bookmarks15"></span><a id="v16"></a>
<div class="p">Then Allāh (s.w.t.) said to Mūsā (a.s.): "Tell Hārūn to take his staff and hit the ground. The dust which is on the ground will turn into gnats and will cover all of Miṣr." And that is exactly what happened.<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>When Hārūn took the staff and hit the ground, all the dust on the ground in Miṣr turned into gnats<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> and began to land on the people and animals.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>The magicians of Miṣr also tried to turn the dust into gnats, but could not.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>Then they said to Firʿawn: "There is Allāh's hand in this." But Firʿawn's heard was hard and he did not let Banī Isrāʾīl go, just as Allāh (s.w.t.) had said.<span id="bookmarks19"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">The fourth plague</div></div><span id="bookmarks19"></span><a id="v20"></a>
<div class="p">Allāh (s.w.t.) to Mūsā (a.s.), "Get up early tomorrow and meet Firʿawn at the bank of the river. Tell him this: 'Let us go,<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>otherwise Allāh (s.w.t.) will cover your houses with flies. All the places where the Miṣriyyūn live will be filled with flies.<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>Only the land of al-Sadīr where Banī Isrāʾīl lives will be free from flies. Then you will know that it is not you who owns this country, but Allāh (s.w.t.).<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span> This sign (āyāt) will happen tomorrow.'"<span id="bookmarks22-23"></span></div><span id="bookmarks22-23"></span><a id="v24"></a>
<div class="p">Everything happened just as Allāh said. The king's palace and the houses of his officials were full of swarms of flies. Because flies were everywhere, life became really difficult.<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>Finally Firʿawn could not bear it anymore and called Mūsā and Hārūn (a.s.) and said: "Alright, go, offer sacrifices to your Ilāh, but do not leave Miṣr."<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>Nabī Mūsā said, "We cannot do this in Miṣr, because the sacrifices we offer are considered an abomination for the Miṣriyyūn. They surely will stone us to death! Besides this,<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>Allāh told us to travel three days' journey and offer sacrifices in the desert".<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>"Well," said Firʿawn, "if it must happen in the desert, then so be it. But do not go very far. And pray for me too! Make this plague go away!"<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>"Good," said Hazrat Mūsā. "As I leave the palace I will pray to Allāh (s.w.t.). By tomorrow this plague will disappear from Miṣr. But do not deceive us again. Do not keep us from offering sacrifices to Allāh (s.w.t.)".<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>With these words the messenger of Allāh left Firʿawn's presence and opened his hands to pray.<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>His prayer was accepted and the plague left Miṣr. Not even one fly was left on the people.<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>After he escaped the flies, Firʿawn again acted stubborn and did not let Banī Isrāʾīl leave Miṣr. <span class="dc">"They would say, whenever a plague struck them, ‘Mūsā, pray to your Lord for us by virtue of the promise He has made to you: if you relieve us of the plague, we will believe you and let the Banī Isrāʾīl go with you,’ but when We relieved them of the plague... lo and behold! they broke it."</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Aʿrāf 7:134-135</span>)<span id="bookmarks32"></span></div>
