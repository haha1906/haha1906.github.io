<div class="s"><div id="s1">THE VISIT OF SHUʿAB (A.S.)</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">When Shuʿab (a.s.), the father-in-law of the prophet Mūsā, heard that Allāh (s.w.t.) had brought Banī Isrāʾīl out of Miṣr,<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v5"></a>he took his daughter Ṣiffūrah and his grandchildren<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>*</sup></span> and went to his son-in-law. At this point Banī Isrāʾīl had come to the plain that was near the mountain Saynāʾ.<span id="bookmarks5"></span></div><span id="bookmarks5"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p">Nabī Mūsā, hearing that his father-in-law was coming, went to meet him. He fell on his knees and kissed his hands. After greeting each other and asking about their welfare, they entered the tent of Mūsā (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>Then the rasul of Allāh (s.w.t.) told his father-in-law one by one the previous events, how they left Miṣr, what kind of difficulties Banī Isrāʾīl had on the road.<span id="bookmarks8"></span></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p">Shuʿab (a.s.) was very happy when he heard of the good deeds that Allāh had done for them.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>He praised Allāh and said,<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>"Now I know that He is higher than all the objects of worship, He saved you from the hands of proud Miṣriyyūn".<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>Then he offered many sacrifices and devoted them to Allāh (s.w.t.).<span id="bookmarks12"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">THE APPOINTMENT OF JUDGES</div></div><span id="bookmarks12"></span><a id="v13"></a>
<div class="p">On the next day nabī Mūsā was busy with the legal cases the people had. Many peole stood near him from morning until evening.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>His father-in-law saw this and asked, "What are you doing? Why are you judging them by yourself, while many people are standing around you from morning until evening?"<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>Nabī Mūsā (a.s.) said: "The people come to me seeking the will of Allāh (s.w.t.).<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>If there is a conflict, I explain to them the judgements and laws of Allāh and give the decision for both sides".<span id="bookmarks16"></span></div><span id="bookmarks16"></span><a id="v17"></a>
<div class="p">Then Shuʿab (a.s.) said: "By doing it this way,<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>you are torturing yourself as well as all the people waiting for you. You cannot do this job alone.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>Let Allāh be your companion. Listen to what I have to say. I will give you some advice: you are a representative for the nation before Allāh (s.w.t.), you present the questions of the people to Allāh.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>You explain to them the judgement and laws, teach them to live on the right path.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>But when it comes to the matter of management, you should choose people who fear Allāh (s.w.t.), who are able, trustworthy and talented and who abhor bribes, and make them heads over groups of 1000, 100, 50 and 10 people.<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>They should always judge the people. They should bring only the most important affairs to you. They will have to solve small affairs by themselves. In this way, your work will be made easier, your burden will be lighter,<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>and you won't get tired. And the people will go back to their homes satisfied. This is the way Allāh wants it to be done".<span id="bookmarks23"></span></div><span id="bookmarks23"></span><a id="v24"></a>
<div class="p">Mūsā (a.s.) listened to what his father-in-law said.<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>He chose able people from the people and made them the heads over groups of 1000, 100, 50 and 10.<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>He put them in charge of the matter of judging the people. They solved small issues but brought big and difficult matters to the Rasulullah.<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>Some days later Shuʿab (a.s.) said goodbye to Mūsā (a.s.) and went back to his homeland.<span id="bookmarks27"></span></div>
