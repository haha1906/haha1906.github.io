Some of them say the <span class=\"wa\">dhabīḥa</span> was Isḥāq ibn Ibrāhīm. But some of them say the <span class=\"it\">dhabīḥa</span> was Ismāʿīl ibn Ibrāhīm. And both sides have quoted <span class=\"it\">riwāya</span> ḥadīths of our Nabī (s.a.w.) to prove that they were right. Those who say that Isḥāq was the <span class=\"it\">dhabīḥa</span> give these ḥadīths: </span></div><div class=\"footnote-p\"><span class=\"ft\">Ibn ʿAbbās (r.a.) gave the riwāya: \"This āya was quoted: 'We have given a big (ram) sacrifice in the place of him.'

Our nabī (s.a.w.) said.'The <span class=\"it\">dhabīḥa</span> was Isḥāq'\" </span></div><div class=\"footnote-p\"><span class=\"ft\">Kaʿb al-Aḥbār said to Abū Hurayrah: \"'Shall I tell you about Isḥāq ibn Ibrāhīm?' When Abū Hurayrah agreed, Kaʿb al-Aḥbār said: 'After Ibrāhīm (a.s.) saw in his dream that he was sacrificing his son, Shayṭān said himself: \"If I will not get Ibrāhīm out of the way now, I will never get him out later.\" Then Shaytan took the appearance of a familiar man and came to the family of Ibrāhīm. He saw that Ibrāhīm (a.s.) was taking his son by his hand and was going to slaughter him. Shaytan noticed what time it was, and he came to Sārah and asked her: \"Where did Ibrāhīm take his son this morning?\" Sārah said: \"Maybe, he went for some work!\" Shayṭān said: \"Not for some work, but he took his son to slaughter him. Ibrāhīm saw a dream, and he thinks that this is what Allāh commanded.\" Sārah said indifferently: \"If Allāh commanded that, it is good that Ibrāhīm and his son Isḥāq are obeying the command of their Rabb\"' <span class=\"it\">(The hadith is long, so we have not given the rest of it). </span> </span></div><div class=\"footnote-p\"><span class=\"ft\">Riwāyas have been given of dozens of ḥadīths from Ibn ʿAbbās with different <span class=\"it\">isnāds </span>, and they all say that Isḥāq was taken to be the qurbān. In addition ʿAbdullāh Ibn Masʿūd, ʿAbdullāh ibn Abiyd, Ibn Thabit, Abū Malik, Masruq and other saḥabas also gave riwāya ḥadīths saying that Isḥāq (a.s.) was the <span class=\"wa\">dhabīḥullah</span>.</span></div>",

<div class="mt"><div id="mt1">The Covenant is tested again <span class="dc">"It was a test to prove [their true characters]"</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Ṣaffāt 37:106</span>).</div></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s1">The last test which came to Ibrāhīm (a.s.)</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Quite some time passed in between. One day Allāh wanted to test prophet Ibrāhīm's <span class="it">faithfulness to the covenant </span> and said: "Ibrāhīm!" Ibrāhīm (a.s.) answered: <span class="wa">labbayk</span> ("Yes, sir!").<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>Allāh said, "Take your son and go to the land you have seen.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> Sacrifice him for Me there on a mountain I will tell you about."</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Let us imagine that you also have a son whom you dearly love and who was born in your old age. So now, if Allāh tells you to sacrifice that son, for whom you prayed for 25 years, how would you feel? What did Ibrāhīm (a.s.) feel at that time? </span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">He loved his son very much. And he was confused, thinking: "Allāh loves my son too, doesn't He? Then why did He command me to sacrifice him?" </span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">"Maybe Allāh wants to raise him from the dead? Of course, Allāh is able to do that", he said to himself with faith. "But what if He does not resurrect him? Then what happens?" Thoughts like this tormented him, but in the end, Nabī Ibrāhīm decided to trust Allāh and obey the decision of the Creator. </span><span id="bookmarks2"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Obedience</div></div><span id="bookmarks2"></span><a id="v3"></a>
<div class="p">Ibrāhīm (a.s.) got up early the next day and saddled his donkey. He chopped some wood to burn the sacrifice and took two of his servants and his son<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span>, and started a journey toward the place Allāh had told him.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>On the third day, the place they were going was visible in the distance.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Then Hazrat Ibrāhīm told his servants: "You wait here. We will go there and after doing <span class="wa">ʿibāda</span> we'll return."<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>Then he put the wood which he had chopped for burning the sacrifice onto his son's shoulder, and he himself took a knife and a flint to start a fire, and they went on in the direction of the mountain.<span id="bookmarks6"></span></div><span id="bookmarks6"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p">"Dear father!" said his son on the way. "Yes, my son?" said İbrahim (a.s.) "We have a flint and wood to make fire," said his son, "but where is the sheep to slaughter as sacrifice!?"<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>Ibrāhīm (a.s.) said, "Allāh Himself will provide the sheep for the sacrifice, my son."<span id="bookmarks8"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">Allāh Himself will provide <span class="dc">"When the boy was old enough to work with his father, Ibrāhīm said, ‘My son, I have seen myself sacrificing you in a dream. What do you think?’ He said, ‘Father, do as you are commanded. Inshāʾallāh, you will find me steadfast.’"</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Ṣaffāt 37:102</span>).</div></div><span id="bookmarks8"></span><a id="v9"></a>
<div class="p">After arriving the place Allāh had said, Hazrat Ibrāhīm made a sacrifice-place and put wood on it. Then his son gave his hands to be tied and Ibrāhīm laid him on the wood.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>Then he took the knife in his hand to sacrifice him.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>Then suddenly a voice came from the sky: "Ibrāhīm! Ibrāhīm!" "Yes, sir", said Ibrāhīm (a.s.).<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>"Do not touch the boy!" said the voice. "Now I know that you are a man of <span class="wa">taqwā</span>, because you did not hold back even your beloved son from Me."<span id="bookmarks12"></span></div><span id="bookmarks12"></span><a id="v13"></a>
<div class="p">Hazrat Ibrāhīm looked up and saw a ram. Its horns were caught in the bushes. He went and brought the ram and he slaughtered it instead of his son and performed the rite of the Ahd sacrifice.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>(Later on the prophet Ibrāhīm named this place "Allāh provides". This is why there is a saying among some people that "Allāh will Himself provide on His mountain.")<span id="bookmarks14"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s4">Comment about burning the sacrifices</div></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">May be someone can ask: Did people burn the sacrifices devoted to Allāh at that time? Why did Ibrāhīm (a.s.) put wood on the altar first?</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">This sacrifice was called <span class="dc">а burning sacrifice </span> \it in the Scripture (see <span class="xdc">ĀlʿImrān 3:183</span>) and when it was done the animal (being sacrificed) was given to Allāh (s.w.t.) fully/completely. No part of it was spared. This meant that a man who was presenting the sacrifice was giving himself completely to the will of Allāh through this sacrifice. </span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s5">What is more expensive: a ram or a son?</div></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Hazrat Ibrāhīm's son was meant to die. But Allāh gave a ram in his place. Ibrāhīm (a.s.) brought the ram and slaughtered it in his son's place.</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">There is a verse in Qurʾān al-Karīm about this: <span class="dc">"We ransomed his son with a great sacrifice."</span> <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span> \it What do you think: which one is worth more, a son or a ram? Of course, a son is worth more! You would probably never exchange your son for a thousand rams. Then why did Allāh say "We ransomed his son with a great sacrifice"?</span></div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">The reason is that the ram Allāh (s.w.t.) gave was a symbol of a Great Sacrifice that was going to be given in the future. What sacrifice is that? We are not perfect. Our obedience to Allāh is not perfect. This is why humanity is in need of the great sacrifice given by Allāh. Sacrifices are made to show our devotion to Allah (s.w.t.), but our sacrifices are never given with a pure heart. Allah (s.w.t.)'s great sacrifice makes a way for us to participate in the blessings and promises of the covenant.</span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s6">All nations will get blessing through your descendant</div></div><span id="bookmarks14"></span><a id="v15"></a>
<div class="p">At that time Allāh said to Hazrat Ibrāhīm:<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>"I swear by My own name that because you trusted Me and did not spare your beloved son from Me,<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>I will surely bless you; I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and the sand on the beach.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>Because you obeyed Me, I will give blessing to the all nations of the earth through your <span class="wa">dhurriyya</span>."</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div><span id="bookmarks18"></span><span id="bookmarks18"></span><a id="v19"></a>
<div class="p">\it Allāh (s.w.t.) said: "I will give blessing through your descendant to all the nations of the earth." Here a special blessing was promised — the blessing of Allah's <span class="wa">raḥma<span class="wa">that will rescue us from our spiritual wrongdoing. Allāh (s.w.t.) promised that Ādam (a.s.)'s wrongdoing would result in a world where the Shaytan fights mankind and where people fight one another and commit sins. However one of the descendants of Ibrāhīm would bring forgiveness to the earth. And this forgiveness has power because of Ibrāhīm's Friendship Covenant (Ahd) with Allāh. And those who enter the covenant will inherit \wa Janna</span>. As it is written in Sūrah al-Muʾminūn: <span class="dc">"They are faithful to their pledges and covenants. They keep up their prayers. They will be the heirs who inherit \wa Firdaws</span> as their own, there to remain (forever)."</span> \it (<span class="xdc">Al-Muʾminūn 23:8-11</span>).<span id="bookmarks19"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s7">The Faith of Ibrāhīm (a.s.)</div></div><span id="bookmarks19"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Hazrat Ibrāhīm believed in the promises of Allāh. Even though Allāh had said: "Your descendants will continue through your son", he took his son to sacrifice him. He did it because he firmly believed that Allāh was able to resurrect his son from the dead. It is easier to say this than to actually take you own son to kill him. Who can do that? Only a man who trusts in Allāh's goodness. If you want to submit yourself to Allāh, you first need to have a good opinion of him and believe that He is good. Whoever wants to come closer to Allāh, he must believe that Allāh rewards those who search after Him. \it Search for Allāh. Those who search for Allāh will never be deprived of Allāh's <span class="wa">raḥma</span>.</span><span id="bookmarks21"></span></div>
