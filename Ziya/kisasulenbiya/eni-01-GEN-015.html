<div class="s"><div id="s1">The Covenant is Confirmed</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">Then Allāh (s.w.t.) gave a revelation to Ibrāhīm and said: "Do not be afraid, Ibrāhīm. I am making a covenant<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> with you. You are under My protection. The reward you will get is very great."<span id="bookmarks1"></span></div><span id="bookmarks1"></span><a id="v2"></a>
<div class="p">But Ibrāhīm (a.s.) said: "Oh my master Allāh! Here, I am still childless. So what will I do with the reward you will give? If I die, will ʿAzīzullah of al-Shām take my property?!<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>You did not give me children, and so the inheritance will be left to my servant."<span id="bookmarks3"></span></div><span id="bookmarks3"></span><a id="v4"></a>
<div class="p">"No," Allāh (s.w.t.) said, "The inheritance will belong to your own son who comes out of your loins, and not to your servant."<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>Then then He took Ibrāhīm outside and said: "Look at the stars in the sky. You won't be able to count all of them. But your descendants will be as many<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> as these stars."<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>(Ibrāhīm (a.s.) was a man who relied on Allāh and for this reason, Allāh gave him the <span class="wa">maqam</span> of <span class="wa">sidq</span>.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span>)<span id="bookmarks6"></span></div><span id="bookmarks6"></span><a id="v7"></a>
<div class="p">Then Allāh said to him: "I brought you out of the land of Kasdāniyyūn in order to give you this earth/land."<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>But Ibrāhīm (a.s.) asked: "Oh my Rabb, how do I know that you will give this land to me?"<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>And Allāh told him: "Bring one three-year-old heifer, one three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a young pigeon and young dove to this place."<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span><span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>So Ibrāhīm went and brought all these animals to sacrifice them in an <span class="wa">ʿAhd</span> (covenant) ceremony. Then he cut all of them in half (except the birds) and arranged them in two rows so that the halves of each animal were opposite each other.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>Allāh did not command him to start a fire, so he waited there and protected the cut animals from vultures.<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>At maghrib Ibrāhīm (a.s.) fell into a deep sleep. Allāh sent him a dream. Everywhere he looked, he could only see frightening darkness.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v15"></a>Then a voice came to him from Allāh: "You will live a long life and die peacefully.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v13"></a>But your descendants will live for 400 years<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-4"><sup>e</sup></span> in a foreign land as strangers. They will suffer oppression under slavery.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>But I will punish that nation and rescue your descendants from them, along with all their possessions.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v16"></a>In four generations, when the sins of the Amūribbūn become too severe, your descendants will come back to this land again."<span id="bookmarks16"></span></div><span id="bookmarks16"></span><a id="v17"></a>
<div class="p">After maghrib, when it was completely dark, Ibrāhīm (a.s.) saw a burning torch and a smoking firepot appear between the two rows. By the power of Allāh, the torch and the firepot passed between each half of the animals that had been sacrificed.<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>In this way, Allāh (s.w.t.) made a Friendship ʿAhd with Ibrāhīm (a.s.) and gave him this promise: "I will give this land to your descendants."<span id="bookmarks18"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2"><span class="wa">Sharḥ</span> about ʿAhd</div></div><span id="bookmarks18"></span><a id="v19"></a>
<div class="ip">\it Now, let us give a short explanation about ʿAhd (covenant). At that time this word meant that a new relationship started between the two parties. (Of course, this Friendship Covenant between Allāh (s.w.t.) and Ibrāhīm (a.s.) is connected to the <span class="wa">mīthāq</span> covenant made on the Day of <span class="wa">Alast</span>. It meant that from that time on they were no longer strangers to one another, but instead they would be faithful to one another and close to each other. This is why the word "covenant" in ancient books often comes together with the word "faithfulness". So the concept of covenant includes duties and responsibilities as well. When Allāh told Ibrāhīm (a.s.): "I have made a covenant with you," the meaning of it is: "I will always be loyal to you, I will fulfill my given promises." When a person enters this covenant, he will participate in the promises of Allāh. In other words, he will receive the blessings of the covenant. There is one more thing you should know: the covenant made with Allāh was not only for that person, but for his descendants as well. This is why Ibrāhīm (a.s.) was surprised and said: "I do not have children, so will my inheritance be left to my servant?" But Allāh (s.w.t.) showed kindness to him and said: "No, I will give you children. Your descendants will inherit these lands."<span id="bookmarks19"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">Promises given through the ʿAhd</div></div><span id="bookmarks19"></span><a id="v20"></a>
<div class="ip"><span class="it">So Allāh has promised three things to Hazrat Ibrāhīm: </span></div>
<div class="ip"><span class="it">&nbsp; that he will have many descendants </span></div>
<div class="ip"><span class="it">&nbsp; that his descendants will possess the earth</span></div>
<div class="ip"><span class="it">&nbsp; and through his descendents (<span class="wa">zurriyya</span>), Allāh would spread blessing to all nations</span><span class="footnote selectable" id="F-5"><sup>f</sup></span> <span class="it">of the earth. And at that time, Ibrāhīm (a.s.) was childless and lived in the territory of Kanʿān in tents. He was a foreigner who did not even have his own house.</span><span id="bookmarks20"></span></div>
