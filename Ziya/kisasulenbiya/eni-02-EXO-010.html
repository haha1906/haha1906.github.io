<div class="s"><div id="s1">The eighth plague</div></div><a id="v3"></a>
<div class="p">Then the messenger of Allāh went to Firʿawn again together with Hārūn (a.s.) and told him, "Allāh (s.w.t.) says: How much longer will you oppose Me? When will you bow your head to Me? Let My people go.<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>Otherwise, I will fill your country with grass-hoppers tomorrow.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>They will eat all the crops and plants that survived the hail, as well as the trees and bushes too. There will be so many grasshoppers that you won't even be able to see the ground!"<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>After he said this, he left the presence of Firʿawn.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>Then Firʿawn's officials came to him and said: "Your Majesty, how long shall we suffer because of this man? Let him go and take his people to fulfil their ibādāt to his Ilāh. Can't you see that all Miṣr is being ruined?"<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>Then Firʿawn called Mūsā and Hārūn (a.s.) back to his presence and said, "Alright, go and do ibādāt to your Ilāh. But who and what will go?"<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>"We will all go, young and old," said nabī Mūsā. "We will take our sons and daughters, and herds and flocks."<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>"For the sake of Allāh!" said Firʿawn sarcastically. "Shall I let you go with your wives and children?! You have cunning intention!<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>No, only the men will go to do ibādāt to your Ilāh. That is what you had requested!" Then he forced Mūsā and Hārūn (a.s.) to leave the palace.<span id="bookmarks11"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">The visit of grasshoppers</div></div><span id="bookmarks11"></span><a id="v12"></a>
<div class="p">Then Allāh (s.w.t.) said to Mūsā (a.s.): "Stretch your hand towards Miṣr."<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>That day the wind started blowing from the east for one day and one night.<span id="bookmarks13"></span> <a id="v14"></a>In the morning swarms of grasshoppers came to Miṣr with the wind.<span id="bookmarks14"></span> <a id="v15"></a>Grasshoppers covered everywhere. Because they were so many, the surface of the ground could not even be seen. All the grass and trees which survived the hail became food<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> for grasshoppers. Nothing green was left on the trees or plants anywhere in Miṣr.<span id="bookmarks15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>Firʿawn became troubled and quickly called Mūsā (and ones with him) to his presence and asked: "I have sinned again against you (plural) and your .<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>Now please, forgive me once more, accept my apologies and ask your Ilāh to take this plague of death away from me."<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>The messenger of Allāh left Firʿawn and as he came out, he prayed to Allāh.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>Then a strong wind blew from the West and took all the grasshoppers and poured them into the Baḥr al-Qilzūm.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>But Firʿawn did not let Banī Isrāʾīl go this time either. (Allāh had made a way for Firʿawn to stay resilient in his decision, freeing his heart from fear.) <span class="dc">"As soon as We relieved their torment they broke their word."</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Zukhruf 43:50</span>)</div>
<div class="b">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p"><span class="it">Firʿawn knew that he was not right. But knowing in itself is not enough. For example, Shayṭān also knows who Allāh (s.w.t.) is. But he does not obey Allāh. Just knowing is not enough. One must do the things in life he knows are right. Are there things in your life, too, that you know are wrong, but you are still doing them?</span><span id="bookmarks20"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">The ninth plague <span class="dc">"In the past, We gave Mūsā nine clear signs– ask the Banī Isrāʾīl about when Mūsā came to [the Miṣriyyūn]"</span> (<span class="xdc">Al-Isrāʾ 17:101</span>).</div></div><span id="bookmarks20"></span><a id="v21"></a>
<div class="p">Then Allāh (s.w.t.) spoke to Hazrat Mūsā: "Stretch your hand towards the sky, and let darkness cover the land of Miṣr".<span id="bookmarks21"></span> <a id="v22"></a>Mūsā (a.s.) stretched his hand towards the sky. All the land of Miṣr was covered with thick darkness for three days.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>For three days no one could see anything; nobody could even move. Only the places where Banī Isrāʾīl lived had light.<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>Then Firʿawn called Mūsā (a.s.) again and said: "Alright, go, do your ibādāt to your Ilāh. Take your children also with you. But your flocks will stay in Miṣr".<span id="bookmarks24"></span> <a id="v25"></a>"No," said the messenger of Allāh. "What will we sacrifice to Allāh (s.w.t.), if we don't take the animals? We can't leave even one animal, because we don't know which animal we will need to sacrifice until we get there".<span id="bookmarks25-26"></span> <a id="v28"></a>"Get out of my sight!" said Firʿawn. "Don't let me you at all. The day you see my face, you will die!"<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>"So be it!" said Hazrat Mūsā. "You will not see my face any more!"<span id="bookmarks29"></span></div><span id="bookmarks29"></span>
