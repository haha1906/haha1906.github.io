<div class="s"><div id="s1">Running away</div></div><a id="v1"></a>
<div class="p">One day Hazrat Yaʿqūb heard that his brothers-in-law were saying: "Yaʿqūb has taken everything that belonged to our father. He became rich at the expense of our father."<span id="bookmarks1"></span> <a id="v2"></a>He also saw that Labān was no longer as friendly as he had been before.<span id="bookmarks2"></span> <a id="v3"></a>On one of these days, a revelation came from Allāh (s.w.t.): "Yaʿqūb, return now to your forefathers' land, to your relatives. I will be with you."<span id="bookmarks3"></span> <a id="v4"></a>After this, Yaʿqūb (a.s.) sent a message to Rāḥīl and Liʾā, tellling them come to the wilderness, where the sheep were.<span id="bookmarks4"></span> <a id="v5"></a>When his wives came, he said this to them: "Your father is not as friendly with me as he used to be. But my father's Allāh is always with me.<span id="bookmarks5"></span> <a id="v6"></a>You know, I have been serving your father from my heart up until today.<span id="bookmarks6"></span> <a id="v7"></a>But he is cheating me. So far he has changed my payment 10 times. Praise be to Allāh, Allāh did not let him to do evil to me.<span id="bookmarks7"></span> <a id="v8"></a>When he said: "your payment will be blotched animals", all the animals started bearing blotched young. When he said: "your payment will be speckled animals", all of them bore speckled young.<span id="bookmarks8"></span> <a id="v9"></a>In this way, Allāh has given me your father's animals.<span id="bookmarks9"></span> <a id="v10"></a>When it was time for the animals to mate, I saw a dream. In my dream all the male goats and rams which were mating were speckled and blotched.<span id="bookmarks10"></span> <a id="v11"></a>Then Allāh's angel told me: "Yaʿqūb." I said: "yes, sir."<span id="bookmarks11"></span> <a id="v12"></a>He said: "Do you see, all the mating male goats are speckled or blotched. This is because Allāh sees all the bad things Labān is doing to you.<span id="bookmarks12"></span> <a id="v13"></a>Do you remember the event that happened in Bītʾīl? You set up a commemoration stone there and poured oil on it. And you took a vow there to Allāh. Now leave this place. Return to the land where you were born." That is what he said to me. Now, what do you say?"<span id="bookmarks13"></span></div><span id="bookmarks13"></span><a id="v14"></a>
<div class="p">Rāḥīl and Liʾā answered Yaʿqūb (a.s.) this: "We have become like strangers to our father. Now we do not have any hope that we will get any inheritance from him. He is treating us like he treats strangers: here, he has sold us<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-0"><sup>a</sup></span> and spent the money from it for himself.<span id="bookmarks14-15"></span> <a id="v16"></a>This is why Allāh took all the animals from him and gave it to us and to our children. Do whatever Allāh told you to do!"<span id="bookmarks16"></span> <a id="v17"></a>After that, Hazrat Yaʿqūb put his wives and children on camels,<span id="bookmarks17"></span> <a id="v18"></a>and gathered up all of his flocks and the wealth he had got in Faddān Arām. Then he started the journey to the land of Kanʿān where his father Isḥāq lived.<span id="bookmarks18"></span> <a id="v19"></a>(Mother Rāḥīl also took her father's timsāls <span class="footnote selectable" id="F-1"><sup>b</sup></span> with her.) At that time Labān had gone to shear his sheep.<span id="bookmarks19"></span> <a id="v20"></a>So, Yaʿqūb (a.s.) departed without letting Labān know.<span id="bookmarks20"></span> <a id="v21"></a>He took all he had and crossed the river al-Furāt and traveled in the direction of the Jilʿād mountains.<span id="bookmarks21"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s2">Labān pursues and Allāh intervenes</div></div><span id="bookmarks21"></span><a id="v22"></a>
<div class="p">For three days Lābān did not hear that they had fled.<span id="bookmarks22"></span> <a id="v23"></a>As soon as he heard it, he gathered his relatives and chased after them. After seven days, he arrived in the mountains of Jilʿād, at the place where Yaʿqūb (a.s.) had set up his tents.<span id="bookmarks23"></span> <a id="v24"></a>That night, Allāh (s.w.t.) warned Labān in his dream and said: "Be careful, do not threaten Yaʿqūb!"<span id="bookmarks24"></span></div><span id="bookmarks24"></span><a id="v25"></a>
<div class="p">The next day Labān<span id="bookmarks25"></span> <a id="v26"></a>came to Yaʿqūb (a.s.) and said: "What is this you have done!? Why did you take my daughters away like prisoners?<span id="bookmarks26"></span> <a id="v27"></a>Why did you flee secretly? If you had said you were leaving, I would have sent you off with songs and music!<span id="bookmarks27"></span> <a id="v28"></a>Why did you did not even let me kiss my grandchildren and say good-bye to them?! You have done a foolish thing!<span id="bookmarks28"></span> <a id="v29"></a>I could do something bad to you. But your father's Allāh gave me guidance in my dream last night and said: "Be careful, do not threaten Yaʿqūb!"<span id="bookmarks29"></span> <a id="v30"></a>I can understand that you left because you longed to return to your father's house, but why did you steal my timsāls?"<span id="bookmarks30"></span> <a id="v31"></a>"I was afraid," answered Hazrat Yaʿqūb, "I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force.<span id="bookmarks31"></span> <a id="v32"></a>But as for your timsāls, whoever did it, they will have to die! Go ahead and search our belongings. Our relatives will be our witnesses! If you find anything of yours, then tell me." Yaʿqūb (a.s.) did not know that Rāḥīl had stolen the timsāls.<span id="bookmarks32"></span> <a id="v33"></a>Lābān started searching his timsāls. First he went into Yaʿqūb's (a.s.) tent, then Liʾā's, then Bilhā's and Zilfā's. He could not find anything, and then he entered Rāḥīl's tent.<span id="bookmarks33"></span> <a id="v34"></a>Mother Rāḥīl had put the timsāls under the saddle of her camel and was sitting on it. Labān entered and started looking everywhere carefully.<span id="bookmarks34"></span> <a id="v35"></a>"Dear father, please forgive me for not standing up," said Rāḥīl, "I have my monthly period, and that is why I did not stand up."</div>
<div class="p">Labān could not find anything and left.<span id="bookmarks35"></span> <a id="v36"></a>Then Hazrat Yaʿqūb became very angry and said to Labān, "What have I done wrong?" he demanded. "What sin have I committed that you are chasing after me?<span id="bookmarks36"></span> <a id="v37"></a>You have looked though everything I own. Did you find anything that belongs to you? If you have, bring it out here in front of our relatives, let them see it!<span id="bookmarks37"></span> <a id="v38"></a>I worked for 20 years in your house. None of your animals miscarried during 20 years. I have not eaten a single sheep from your flock.<span id="bookmarks38"></span> <a id="v39"></a>Even when wolves took some sheep, I paid for it myself. No matter whether it happened in the daytime or at night, you made me pay for every lost animal from the flock.<span id="bookmarks39"></span> <a id="v40"></a>I suffered from heat in the day, and from the cold at night. I was not able to sleep.<span id="bookmarks40"></span> <a id="v41"></a>I spent twenty years my life in your house like this. For two of your daughters I served you for fourteen years. Then I shepherded your flocks for six more years. During these six years you have changed my payment ten times.<span id="bookmarks41"></span> <a id="v42"></a>If the Allāh of my grandfather Ibrāhīm and my father Isḥāq Allāh had not interfered, even now you would have sent me with nothing. Allāh has seen my misery and my sufferings, and this is why He warned you last night."<span id="bookmarks42"></span></div><span id="bookmarks42"></span><a id="v43"></a>
<div class="p">Labān answered, "Your wives are my daughters, your children are my children, your flocks are also my flocks. All these in reality are mine. But today, as it is, I do not have any say over my own daughters and grandchildren.<span id="bookmarks43"></span> <a id="v44"></a>Alright, come, let us make an agreement between ourselves. This agreement will be a witness between us."<span id="bookmarks44"></span></div>

<div class="s"><div id="s3">The agreement between Yaʿqūb (a.s.) and Labān</div></div><span id="bookmarks44"></span><a id="v45"></a>
<div class="p">Hazrat Yaʿqūb agreed and stood up a stone as a sign of the agreement.<span id="bookmarks45"></span> <a id="v46"></a>Then he said to his relatives: "Gather stones". They brought stones and gathered them in one place.<span id="bookmarks46"></span> <a id="v47"></a>Labān named the pile of stones Rajm al-Shahādah, and Yaʿqūb (a.s.) named it Jalʿīd. (Both words mean "Stone Hill of Witness". Rajm al-Shahādah is in the Aramaic language, and Jalʿīd is in al-ʿIbrāniy.<span id="bookmarks47"></span> <a id="v48"></a>This hill was also called Maṭlaʿ.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-2"><sup>c</sup></span>)<span id="bookmarks48-49"></span> <a id="v50"></a>Labān said, "If you treat my daughter badly or if you marry other wives, Allāh will see it even if I do not. This hill and this stone will be witnesses to the agreement between us.<span id="bookmarks50-51"></span> <a id="v52"></a>Neither of us will cross over this line and do bad things to the other.<span id="bookmarks52"></span> <a id="v53"></a>May the Allāh that our fathers Ibrāhīm and Nāḥūr worshipped be a judge between us." Then Yaʿqūb (a.s.) swore by the name of the Allāh of his father and grandfather.<span id="bookmarks53"></span> <a id="v54"></a>Then they slaughtered a sacrifice on that hill and invited everybody to meal.<span class="footnote selectable" id="F-3"><sup>d</sup></span> After the feast, they spent the night there.<span id="bookmarks54"></span> <a id="v55"></a>The next morning Labān got up early, kissed his daughters and grandchildren, prayed for them and went back home.<span id="bookmarks55"></span></div><span id="bookmarks55"></span>
